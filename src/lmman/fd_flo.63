.cindex control structure
.cindex flow of control
	Lisp provides a variety of structures for flow of control.

	Function application is the basic method for construction of
programs.  Operations are written as the application of a function
to its arguments.  Usually, Lisp programs are written as a large collection
of small functions, each of which implements a simple operation.
These functions operate by calling one another, and so larger
operations are defined in terms of smaller ones.

'cindex "recursion"
	A function may always call itself in Lisp.  The calling of
a function by itself is known as 2recursion*; it is analogous
to mathematical induction.

'cindex "iteration"
	The performing of an action repeatedly (usually with some
changes between repetitions) is called 2iteration*, and is provided
as a basic control structure in most languages.  The 2do* statement
of PL/I, the 2for* statement of ALGOL/60, and so on are examples
of iteration primitives.  Lisp provides a general iteration facility
called 3do*, which is explained below.

'cindex "conditional"
	A 2conditional* construct is one which allows a program
to make a decision, and do one thing or another based on some logical
condition.  Lisp provides 3and* and 3or*, which are simple
conditionals, and 3cond*, which is a more general conditional.

'cindex "non-local exit"
'cindex "exits"
	Non-local exits are similar to the 2leave*, 2exit*, and
2escape* constructs in many modern languages.
'c French, Italian, ...
They are similar to
a 2return*, but are more general.  In Lisp, their scope is
determined at run-time.  They are implemented as the 3catch* and
3*throw* functions.

	Lisp Machine Lisp also provides a multiple-process or coroutine capability.
This is explained in the section on 2stack-groups* ((stack-group)).

.section "Conditionals"

.defspec and
3(and 2form1 form2* ... )* evaluates the 2form*s one at a time,
from left to right.  If any 2form* evaluates to 3nil*, 3and*
immediately returns 3nil* without evaluating the remaining
2forms*.  If all the 2forms* evaluate non-3nil*, 3and* returns
the value of the last 2form*.  3and* can be used both for logical operations,
where 3nil* stands for 2False* and 3t* stands for 2True*, and as a
conditional expression. 
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(and x y)

(and (setq temp (assq x y))
     (rplacd temp z))

(and (not error-p)
     (princ "There was no error."))
.end_lisp
Note: 3(and) => t*, which is the identity for this operation.
.end_defspec

.defspec or
3(or 2form1 form2* ...)* evaluates the 2form*s one by one from left to right.
If a 2form* evaluates to 3nil*, 3or* proceeds to evaluate the
next 2form*.  If there are no more 2form*s, 3or* returns 3nil*.
But if a 2form* evaluates non-3nil*, 3or* immediately returns
that value without evaluating any remaining 2form*s.  3or* can
be used both for logical operations, where 3nil* stands for False
and 3t* for True, and as a conditional expression.

Note:  3(or) => nil*, the identity for this operation.
.end_defspec

.defspec cond
The 3cond* special form consists of the symbol 3cond* followed by
several 2clauses*.  Each clause consists of a 2predicate* followed
by zero or more 2forms*.  Sometimes the predicate is called the
2antecedent* and the forms are called the 2consequents*. 

.lisp
(cond (2antecedent consequent consequent*...)
      (2antecedent*)
      (2antecedent consequent* ...)
      ... )
.end_lisp

The idea is that each clause represents a case which
is selected if its antecedent is satisfied and the antecedents
of all preceding clauses were not satisfied.  When a clause
is selected, its consequent forms are evaluated.

3cond* processes its clauses in order from left to right.  First,
the antecedent of the current clause is evaluated.  If the result is
3nil*, 3cond* advances to the next clause.  Otherwise, the cdr of
the clause is treated as a list of forms, or consequents, which are
evaluated in order from left to right.  After evaluating the
consequents, 3cond* returns without inspecting any remaining
clauses.  The value of the 3cond* special form is the value of the
last consequent evaluated, or the value of the antecedent if there
were no consequents in the clause.  If 3cond* runs out of clauses,
that is, if every antecedent is 3nil*, that is, if no case is
selected, the value of the 3cond* is 3nil*. 
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
    (cond ((zerop x)    ;1First clause:*
           (+ y 3))     ; (zerop x)1 is the antecedent.*
                        ; (+ y 3)1 is the consequent.*
          ((null y)     ;1A clause with 2 consequents:*
           (setq y 4)   ;1 this*
           (cons x z))  ;1 and this.*
          (z)           ;1A clause with no consequents:*
			;1 the antecedent is just z.*
	  (t		;1An antecedent of *t
	   105)		;1 is always satisfied.*
       )		;1This is the end of the cond.*
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

.defmac if
3if* allows a simple "if-then-else" conditional to
be expressed as 3(if 2pred-form* 2then-form* 2else-form*)*.
3if* is provided for stylistic reasons; some people think
it looks nicer than 3cond* for the simple case it handles.
3(if 2x y z*)* expands into 3(cond (2x* 2y*) (t 2z*))*.
.end_defmac

.defmac selectq
Many programs require 3cond* forms which check various
specific values of a form.
.lisp
1A typical example:*
(cond ((eq x 'foo) ...)
      ((eq x 'bar) ...)
      ((memq x '(baz quux mum)) ...)
      (t ...))
.end_lisp
The 3selectq* macro can be used for such tests.  
Its form is as follows:
.lisp
(selectq 2key-form*
	 (2pattern consequent consequent* ...)
	 (2pattern consequent consequent* ...)
	 (2pattern consequent consequent* ...)
	 ...)
.end_lisp
Its first "argument" is a form, which is evaluated (only once) as the
first thing 3selectq* does.  The resulting value is called the 2key*.  It is
followed by any number of 2clauses*.  The 3car* of each clause is
compared with the key, and if it matches, the consequents of this
clause are evaluated, and 3selectq* returns the value of the last
consequent.  If there are no matches, 3selectq* returns 3nil*.
Note that the patterns are 2not* evaluated; if you want them to
be evaluated use 3select* rather than 3selectq*.
	A 2pattern* may be any of:
.table 1 500 1500 0 80 1
.item 1) A symbol
If the 2key* is 3eq* to the symbol, it matches.
.item 2) A number
If the 2key* is 3eq* to the number, it matches.
Only small numbers (2fixnums*) will work.
.item 3) A list
If the 2key* is 3eq* to one of the elements of the list,
then it matches.  The elements of the list should be symbols
or fixnums.
.item 4) 3t* or 3otherwise*
The symbols 3t* and 3otherwise* are special keywords which match anything.  
Either symbol may be used, it makes no difference.
3t* is accepted for compatibility with Maclisp's 3caseq* construct.
.end_table
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(selectq x		;1This is the same as the 3cond* example*
	 (foo ...)	;1 above.*
	 (bar ...)
	 ((baz quux mum) ...)
	 (otherwise ...))
.end_lisp
.end_defmac

.defmac select
3select* is the same as 3selectq*, except that the elements of the
patterns are evaluated before they are used.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(select (frob x)
   (foo 1)
   ((bar baz) 2)
   (otherwise 3))
1is equivalent to*
(let ((var (frob x)))
  (cond ((eq var foo) 1)
	((or (eq var bar) (eq var baz)) 2)
	(t 3)))
.end_lisp
.end_defmac

.defmac dispatch
3(dispatch 2byte-specifier* 2n* 2clauses...*)* is the same
as 3select* (not 3selectq*), but the key is obtained by evaluating
3(ldb 2byte-specifier n*)*.
'findex "ldb"
2byte-specifier* and 2n* are both evaluated.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(princ (dispatch 0202 cat-type
	   (0 "Siamese.")
	   (1 "Persian.")
	   (2 "Alley.")
	   (3 (ferror nil
		      "~S is not a known cat type."
		      cat-type))))

.end_defmac

.section "Iteration"
'cindex "iteration"
.defspec prog
3prog* is a special form which provides temporary variables,
sequential evaluation of forms, and a "goto" facility.  A typical 3prog*
looks like:
.lisp
(prog (2var1 var2* (2var3 init3*) 2var4* (2var5 init5*))
 2tag1*
     2statement1*
     2statement2*
 2tag2*
     2statement2*
     . . .
    )
.end_lisp
2var1, var2, ...* are temporary variables.  When the 3prog* is entered, the
values of these variables are saved.  When the 3prog* is finished,
the saved values are restored.  The initial value of a variable inside
the 3prog* depends on whether the variable had an associated 2init*
form or not; if it did, then the 2init* form is evaluated and becomes
the initial value of the corresponding variable.  If there was no 2init* form,
the variable is initialized to 3nil*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(prog ((a t)  b  (c 5)  (d (car '(zz . pp))))
      2<body>*
      )
.end_lisp
The initial value of 3a* is 3t*, that of 3b* is 3nil*, that of 3c* is
the fixnum 5, and that of 3d* is the symbol 3zz*.
The binding and initialization of the variables is done 2sequentially*, so
each one can depend on the previous ones.

	The part of a 3prog* after the variable list is called the 2body*.
An item in the body may be a symbol or a number, in which case it is called a
2tag*, or some other form (i.e. a list), in which case it is called a 
2statement*.

	After 3prog* binds the temporary variables, it processes each form
in its body sequentially.  2tags* are skipped over.  2Statements*
are evaluated, and their returned values discarded.  If the end of the body
is reached, the 3prog* returns 3nil*.  However, two special forms
may be used in 3prog* bodies to alter the flow of control.
If 3(return 2x*)* is evaluated,
3prog* stops processing its body, evaluates 2x*, and returns the result.
If 3(go 2tag*)* is evaluated, 3prog* jumps to the part of the body
labelled with the 2tag*.  2tag* is not evaluated.
The "computed-3go*" (mis)feature of Maclisp is not supported.

	The compiler requires that 3go* and 3return* forms be
2lexically* within the scope of the 3prog*; it is not possible for
one function to 3return* to a 3prog* which is in progress in its
caller.  This restriction happens not to be enforced in the interpreter.
Thus, a program which contains a 3go* which is not
contained within the body of a 3prog* (or a 3do*, see below)
cannot be compiled.  Since virtually all programs will be compiled
at some time, the restriction should be adhered to.

	Sometimes code which is lexically within more than one 3prog*
(or 3do*) form wants to 3return* from one of the outer 3prog*s.
However, the 3return* function normally returns from the innermost 
3prog*.  In order to make 3return*ing from outer 3prog*s more
convenient, a 3prog* may be given a 2name* by which it may be
referenced by a function called 3return-from*, which is similar to
3return* but allows a particular 3prog* to be specified.
If the first subform of a 3prog* is a non-3nil* symbol
(rather than a variable list), it is the name of the 3prog*.
See the description of the 3return-from* special form,
on (return-from-fun).
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(prog george (a b d)
      (prog (c b)
            ...
            (return-from george (cons b d))
            ...))
.end_lisp

	If the symbol 3t* is used as the name
of a 3prog*, then it will be made "invisible" to 3return*s;
3return*s inside that 3prog* will return to the next outermost level
whose name is not 3t*.  3(return-from t ...)* will return
from a 3prog* named 3t*.

See also the 3do* special form, which uses a body similar to
3prog*. The 3do*, 3*catch*, and 3*throw* special forms are
included in Lisp Machine Lisp as an attempt to encourage goto-less programming
style, which often leads to more readable, more easily maintained code.  The
programmer is recommended to use these functions instead of 3prog*
wherever reasonable. 
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(prog (x y z)  ;x, y, z1 are prog variables  - temporaries.*
   (setq y (car w) z (cdr w))     ;w1 is a free variable.*
loop
   (cond ((null y) (return x))
         ((null z) (go err)))
rejoin
   (setq x (cons (cons (car y) (car z))
                 x))
   (setq y (cdr y)
         z (cdr z))
   (go loop)
err
   (break are-you-sure? t)
   (setq z y)
   (go rejoin))
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

.defspec do
The 3do* special form provides a generalized iteration facility,
with an arbitrary number of "index variables" whose values are saved
when the 3do* is entered and restored when it is left, i.e. they are
bound by the 3do*.  The index variables are used in the iteration
performed by 3do*.  At the beginning, they are initialized to
specified values, and then at the end of each trip around the loop the
values of the index variables are changed according to specified
rules.  3do* allows the programmer to specify a predicate which
determines when the iteration will terminate.  The value to be
returned as the result of the form may, optionally, be specified. 

3do* comes in two varieties.

The newer variety of
3do* looks like:
.lisp
(do ((2var init repeat*)...)
    (2end-test exit-form*...)
    2body*...)
.end_lisp

The first item in the form is a list of zero or more index variable
specifiers.  Each index variable specifier is a list of the name of a
variable 2var*, an initial value 2init*, which defaults to 3nil*
if it is omitted, and a repeat value 2repeat*.  If 2repeat* is
omitted, the 2var* is not changed between loops. 

All assignment to the index variables is done in parallel.  At the
beginning of the first iteration, all the 2init*s are evaluated,
then the 2var*s are saved, then the 2var*s are 2set* to the
values of the 2init*s.  To put it another way, the 2var*s are
3lambda*-bound to the values of the 2init*s.  Note that the
2init*s are evaluated 2before* the 2var*s are bound, i.e.
lexically 2outside* of the 3do*.
At the beginning of each succeeding iteration those 2var*s that have
2repeat*s get 3setq*'ed to the values of their respective
2repeat*s.  Note that all the 2repeat*s are evaluated before any
of the 2var*s is changed. 

The second element of the 3do*-form is a list of an end-testing
predicate 2end-test*, and zero or more forms, called the
2exit-form*s.  At the beginning of each iteration, after processing
of the 2repeat*s, the 2end-test* is evaluated.  If the result is
3nil*, execution proceeds with the body of the 3do*.  If the
result is not 3nil*, the 2exit-forms* are evaluated from left to
right and then 3do* returns.  The value of the 3do* is the value
of the last 2exit-form*, or 3nil* (2not* the value of the
2end-test* as you might expect) if there were no 2exit-form*s. 
Note that the second element of the 3do*-form resembles a 3cond*
clause. 

If the second element of the form is 3nil*, there is no 2end-test*
nor 2exit-form*s, and the 2body* of the 3do* is executed only
once.  In this type of 3do* it is an error to have 2repeat*s. 
This type of 3do* is a "3prog* with initial values."

If the second element of the form is 3(nil)*, the 2end-test* is never
true and there are no 2exit-form*s.  The 2body* of the 3do*
is executed over and over. 
The infinite loop can be terminated by use of 3return* or 3*throw*.

The remainder of the 3do*-form constitutes a 3prog*-body; that is,
3go*'s and 3return* forms are understood within the 3do* body,
as if it were a 3prog* body.  When the end of the body is reached,
the next iteration of the 3do* begins.  If a 3return* form is evaluated,
3do* returns the indicated value and no more iterations occur. 

The older variety of 3do* is:
.lisp
(do 2var* 2init* 2repeat* 2end-test* 2body*...)
.end_lisp
The first time through the loop 2var* gets the value of 2init*; 
the remaining times through the loop it gets the value of 2repeat*,
which is re-evaluated each time.  Note that 2init* is evaluated
before the value of 2var* is saved, i.e. lexically 2outside* of the 3do*.
Each time around the loop, after 2var* is set,
2end-test* is evaluated.  If it is non-3nil*, the 3do* finishes
and returns 3nil*.  If the 2end-test* evaluated to 3nil*, the 2body* of
the loop is executed.  The 2body* is like a 3prog* body.  3go*
may be used.  If 3return* is used, its argument is the value of the
3do*.  If the end of the 3prog* body is reached, another loop
begins. 

.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples of the older variety of 3do*:
(setq n (array-length foo-array))
(do i 0 (1+ i) (= i n)
  (aset 0 foo-array i))		1;zeroes out the array foo-array*

(do zz x (cdr zz) (or (null zz)
		      (zerop (f (car zz)))))
                   1; this applies f to each element of x
                   ; continuously until f returns zero.
		   ; Note that the 3do* has no body.*

13return* forms are often useful to do simple searches:*

(do i 0 (1+ i) (= i n)	1; Iterate over the length of 3foo-array*.*
  (and (= (aref foo-array i) 5)	1; If we find an element which
				;equals 35*,*
       (return i)))	1;  then return its index.*

.end_lisp
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples of the new form of 3do*:
(do ((i 0 (1+ i))	1; This is just the same as the above example,*
     (n (array-length foo-array)))
    ((= i n))		1; but written as a new-style 3do*.*
  (aset 0 foo-array i))

(do ((z list (cdr z)) 1; z starts as 3list* and is 2cdr*'ed each time.*
     (y other-list)   1; y starts as 3other-list*, and is unchanged by the do.*
     (x))	      1; x starts as 3nil* and is not changed by the 3do*.*
    (nil)	      1; The end-test is 3nil*, so this is an infinite loop.*
  2body*)

(do ((x) (y) (z)) (nil) 2body*)

1is like*

(prog (x y z) 2body*)
1except that when it runs off the end of the 2body*,
3do* loops but 3prog* returns 3nil*.

On the other hand,*

     (do ((x) (y) (z)) nil 2body*)

1is identical to the 3prog* above (it does not loop.)*
.end_lisp

The construction
.lisp
(do ((x e (cdr x))
     (oldx x x))
    ((null x))
  2body*)
.end_lisp
exploits parallel assignment to index variables.  On the first
iteration, the value of 3oldx* is whatever value 3x* had before
the 3do* was entered.  On succeeding iterations, 3oldx* contains
the value that 3x* had on the previous iteration. 

In either form of 3do*, the 2body* may contain no forms at all.
Very often an iterative algorithm can be most clearly expressed entirely
in the 2repeats* and 2exit-forms* of a new-style 3do*,
and the 2body* is empty.

.end_defspec

.defspec do-named
3do-named* is just like 3do* except that its first subform
is a symbol, which is interpreted as the 2name* of the 3do*.
The 3return-from* special form allows a 3return* from
a particular 3prog* or 3do-named* when several are nested.
See the description of such names in the explanation of the 3prog*
special form on (prog-fun), and that of 3return-from* on (return-from-fun).

.defspec dotimes
3dotimes* is a convenient abbreviation for the most common integer iteration.
3(dotimes (2index* 2count*) 2body...*)* performs 2body*
the number of times given by the value of 2count*, with 2index* bound
to 30*, 31*, etc. on successive iterations.

once for each element in the list which is the value of 2list*, with
2item* bound to the successive elements.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(dolist (item (frobs foo))
  (mung item))
.exdent 96 1is equivalent to:*
(do ((lst (frobs foo) (cdr lst))
     (item))
    ((null lst))
  (setq item (car lst))
  (mung item))
.exdent 96 1except that the name 3lst* is not used.*

.defspec go
The 3(go 2tag*)* special form is used to do a "go-to" within the
body of a 3do* or a 3prog*.  The 2tag* must be a symbol.
It is not evaluated. 3go* transfers control to the point in the body labelled by a
tag 3eq* to the one given.  If there is no such tag in the body, the
bodies of lexically containing 3prog*s and 3do*s (if any) are examined as well.
If no tag is found, an error is signalled.
	Note that the 3go* form is a very special form: it does not ever
return a value.  A 3go* form may not appear as an argument to a regular
function, but only at the top level of a 3prog* or 3do*,
or within certain special forms such as conditionals which are within
a 3prog* or 3do*.
A 3go* as an argument to a regular function would be not only useless but
possibly meaningless.  The compiler does not bother to know how to compile it
correctly.  3return* and 3*throw* are similar.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(prog (x y z)
  (setq x 2some frob*)
loop
  2do something*
  (and 2some predicate* (go endtag))
  2do something more*
  (and (minusp x) (go loop))
endtag
  (return z))
.end_lisp
.end_defspec

.defun return arg
3return* is used to return from a 3prog* or a 3do*.  The value
of 3return*'s argument is returned by 3prog* or 3do* as its
value.  In addition, 3break* recognizes the typed-in S-expression
3(return 2value*)* specially.  If this form is typed at a
3break*, 2value* will be evaluated and returned as the value of
3break*.  If not at the top level of a form typed at a 3break*,
and not inside a 3prog* or 3do*, 3return* will cause an
error. 
.c  Does our BREAK hack this yet?
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(do ((x x (cdr x))
     (n 0 (* n 2)))
    ((null x) n)
 (cond ((atom (car x))
        (setq n (1+ n)))
       ((memq (caar x) '(sys boom bleah))
        (return n))))
.end_lisp
3return* is, like 3go*, a special form which does not return a value.

3return* can also be used to return multiple values from a 3prog* or
3do*, by giving it multiple arguments.  For example,
.lisp
(defun assqn (x table)
  (do ((l table (cdr l))
       (n 0 (1+ n)))
      ((null l) nil)
    (and (eq (caar l) x)
	 (return (car l) n))))
.end_lisp
This function is like 3assq*, but it returns an additional value
which is the index in the table of the entry it found.
See the special forms 3multiple-value* ((multiple-value-fun))
and 3multiple-value-list* ((multiple-value-list-fun)).
.end_defun

.defspec return-from
A 3return-from* form looks like 3(return-from 2name form1 form2 form3*)*.
The 2form*s are evaluated sequentially, and then are returned
from the innermost containing 3prog* or 3do-named* whose name
is 2name*.  See the description of 3prog* ((prog-fun)) in which
named 3prog*s and 3do*s are explained, and that of 3do-named* ((do-named-fun)).
.end_defspec

.defun return-list list
2list* must not be 3nil*.  This function is like 3return* except
that the 3prog* returns all of the elements of 2list*; if
2list* has more then one element, the 3prog* does a multiple-value
return.
.c What is this good for?
	To direct the returned values to a 3prog* or 3do-named* of a specific
name, use 3(return-from 2name* (return-list 2list*))*.
.end_defun

.defspec multiple-value-return
3(multiple-value-return (2function* 2arg1* 2arg2* ...))*
applies the function to the arguments, and returns from the current 3prog* or 3do*
with the same values as 2function* returns.
.end_defspec

.defmac defunp
Usually when a function uses 3prog*, the 3prog* form is
the entire body of the function; the definition of such a function
looks like 3(defun 2name* 2arglist* (prog 2varlist* ...))*.
For convenience, the 3defunp* macro can be used to produce such definitions.
A 3defunp* form expands as follows:
.lisp
(defunp fctn (args)
    form1
    form2
    ...
    formn)
.end_lisp
expands into
.lisp
(defun fctn (args)
  (prog nil
	form1
	form2
	...
	(return formn)))

.section "Non-local Exits"
'cindex "non-local exit"
'cindex catch
'cindex throw

.defun *catch tag form
3*catch* is the Lisp Machine Lisp function for doing structured
non-local exits.  3(*catch 2tag form*)* evaluates 2form* and
returns its value, except that if, during the evaluation of 2form*,
3(*throw 2tag y*)* should be evaluated, 3*catch* immediately returns
2y* without further evaluating 2x*.  Note that the 2form* argument
is 2not* evaluated twice; the special action of 3*catch* happens
during the evaluation of its arguments, not during the execution of 3*catch*
itself.

The 2tag*'s are used to match up 3*throw*'s with 3*catch*'s. 
3(*catch 'foo 2form*)* will catch a 3(*throw 'foo 2form*)* but
not a 3(*throw 'bar 2form*)*.  It is an error if 3*throw* is done
when there is no suitable 3*catch* (or 3catch-all*; see below). 

The values 3t* and 3nil* for 2tag* are special and mean that all
throws are to be caught.  These are used by 3unwind-protect* and 3catch-all*
respectively.  The only difference between 3t* and 3nil* is in the
error checking; 3t* implies that after a "cleanup handler" is executed
control will be thrown again to the same tag, therefore it is an error if a specific
catch for this tag does not exist higher up in the stack.

3*catch* returns up to four values; trailing null values are not
returned for reasons of microcode simplicity, however the values not
returned will default to 3nil* if they are received with the
3multiple-value* special form.
If the catch completes normally,
the first value is the value of 2form* and the second is 3nil*.
If a 3*throw* occurs, the first value is the second argument to
3*throw*, and the second value is the first argument to 3*throw*,
the tag thrown to.  The third and fourth values are the third and fourth
arguments to 3*unwind-stack* if that was used in place of 3*throw*,
otherwise 3nil*.
To summarize, the four values returned by 3*catch* are the value,
the tag, the active-frame-count, and the action.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example
(*catch 'negative
	(mapcar (function (lambda (x) 
                            (cond ((minusp x)
				   (*throw 'negative x))
				  (t (f x)) )))
               y)
     )
.end_lisp
which returns a list of 3f* of each element of 3y* if they are all
positive, otherwise the first negative member of 3y*. 

Note: The Lisp Machine Lisp functions 3*catch* and 3*throw* are
improved versions of the Maclisp functions 3catch* and 3throw*. 
The Maclisp ones are similar in purpose, but take their arguments in
reversed order, do not evaluate the 2tag*, and may be used in an older form
in which no 2tag* is supplied.  Compatibility macros are supplied so
that programs using the Maclisp functions will work.
.end_defun

.defun *throw tag value
3*throw* is used with 3*catch* as a structured non-local exit mechanism.

3(*throw 2tag x*)* throws the value of 2x* back to the most recent 3*catch*
labelled with 2tag* or 3t* or 3nil*.  Other 3*catches* are skipped over.
Both 2x* and 2tag* are evaluated, unlike the Maclisp 3throw* function.

The values 3t* and 3nil* for 2tag* are reserved.  3nil* may not
be used, because it would cause an ambiguity in the returned values of 3*catch*.
3t* invokes a special feature whereby the entire stack is unwound, and then
a coroutine transfer to the invoking stack-group is done.  During this process
3unwind-protect*s receive control, but 3catch-all*s do not.  This feature
is provided for the benefit of system programs which want to completely unwind a stack.
It leaves the stack-group in a somewhat inconsistent state; it is best to
do a 3stack-group-preset* immediately afterwards.

See the description of 3*catch* for further details.
.end_defun

.defmac catch
.defmac1 throw
3catch* and 3throw* are provided only for Maclisp compatibility.
They expand as follows:
.lisp
(catch 2form* 2tag*) ==> (*catch (quote 2tag*) 2form*)
(throw 2form* 2tag*) ==> (*throw (quote 2tag*) 2form*)
.end_lisp
The forms of 3catch* and 3throw* without tags are not supported.
.end_defmac

'cindex unwinding a stack
.defun *unwind-stack tag value active-frame-count action
This is a generalization of 3*throw* provided for program-manipulating
programs such as the error handler.

2tag* and 2value* are the same as the corresponding arguments to
3*throw*.

2active-frame-count*, if non-3nil*, is the number of frames
to be unwound.  If this counts down to zero before a suitable 3*catch*
is found, the 3*unwind-stack* terminates and
2that frame* returns 2value* to whoever called it.
This is similar to Maclisp's 3freturn* function.
'findex "freturn"

If 2action* is non-3nil*, whenever the 3*unwind-stack* would be
ready to terminate (either due to 2active-frame-count* or due to
2tag* being caught as in 3*throw*), instead, a stack-group call is
forced to the previous stack-group, generally the error handler.  The
unwound stack-group is left in 2awaiting-return* state, such that the
value returned when the stack-group is resumed will become the value
returned by the frame, (i.e. the 2value* argument to
3*unwind-stack* will be ignored in this case, and the value passed to
the stack group when it is resumed will be used instead.)

Note that if both 2active-frame-count* and 2action* are 3nil*,
3*unwind-stack* is identical to 3*throw*.
.end_defun

'cindex unwind protection
'cindex cleanup handlers
.defmac unwind-protect
Sometimes it is necessary to evaluate a form and make sure that
certain side-effects take place after the form is evaluated;
a typical example is:
.lisp
(progn
   (turn-on-water-faucet)
   (hairy-function 3 nil 'foo)
   (turn-off-water-faucet))
.end_lisp
The non-local exit facility of Lisp creates a situation in which
the above code won't work, however: if 3hairy-function* should
do a 3*throw* to a 3*catch* which is outside of the 3progn*
form, then 3(turn-off-water-faucet)* will never be evaluated
(and the faucet will presumably be left running).

In order to allow the above program to work, it can
be rewritten using 3unwind-protect* as follows:
.lisp
(unwind-protect
  (progn (turn-on-water-faucet)
	 (hairy-function 3 nil 'foo))
  (turn-off-water-faucet))
.end_lisp
If 3hairy-function* does a 3*throw* which attempts to quit
out of the evaluation of the 3unwind-protect*, the
3(turn-off-water-faucet)* form will be evaluated in between
the time of the 3*throw* and the time at which the 3*catch* returns.
If the 3progn* returns normally, then the 3(turn-off-water-faucet)*
is evaluated, and the 3unwind-protect* returns the result of the 3progn*.
One thing to note is that 3unwind-protect* cannot return multiple values.

The general form of 3unwind-protect* looks like
.lisp
(unwind-protect 2protected-form*
                2form1*
                2form2*
                ...)
.end_lisp
2protected-form* is evaluated, and when it returns or when it
attempts to quit out of the 3unwind-protect*, the 2form*s
are evaluated.
.end_defmac

.defmac let-globally
3let-globally* is similar in form to 3let* (see (let-fun)).
The difference is that 3let-globally* does not 2bind* the
variables; instead, it 2sets* them, and sets up an 3unwind-protect*
(see (unwind-protect-fun)) to set them back.  The important
difference between 3let-globally* and 3let* is that when
the current stack group (see (stack-group)) cocalls some other stack
group, the old values of the variables are 2not* restored.
.end_defmac

.defmac catch-all
3(catch-all 2form*)* is like 3(*catch 2some-tag form*)*
except that it will catch a
3*throw* to any tag at all.  Since the tag thrown to
is the second returned value, the caller of 3catch-all* may continue 
throwing to that tag if he wants.  The one thing that 3catch-all*
will not catch is a 3*throw* to 3t*.
3catch-all* is a macro which expands into 3*catch* with a 2tag* of 3nil*.

.section "Mapping"
'cindex "mapping"

.defun map fcn &rest lists
.defun1 mapc fcn &rest lists
.defun1 maplist fcn &rest lists
.defun1 mapcar fcn &rest lists
.defun1 mapcon fcn &rest lists
.defun1 mapcan fcn &rest lists

Mapping is a type of iteration in which a function is 
successively applied to pieces of a list.
There are several options for the way in which the pieces of the list are
chosen and for what is done with the results returned by the applications of
the function.

For example, 3mapcar* operates on successive 2elements* of the list. 
As it goes down the list, it calls the function giving it an element
of the list as its one argument:  first the 3car*, then the
3cadr*, then the 3caddr*, etc., continuing until the end of the
list is reached.  The value returned by 3mapcar* is a list of the
results of the successive calls to the function.  An example of the
use of 3mapcar* would be 3mapcar*'ing the function 3abs* over
the list 3(1 -2 -4.5 6.0e15 -4.2)*, which would be written as
3(mapcar (function abs) '(1 -2 -4.5 6.0e15 -4.2))*.
The result is 3(1 2 4.5 6.0e15
4.2)*.  

In general, the mapping functions take any number of arguments.  For example,
.lisp
(mapcar 2f x1 x2 ... xn*)
.end_lisp
In this case 2f* must be a function of 2n* arguments.
3mapcar* will proceed
down the lists 2x1, x2, ..., xn* in parallel.
The first argument to 2f* will
come from 2x1*, the second from 2x2*, etc.
The iteration stops as soon as
any of the lists is exhausted.

There are five other mapping functions besides 3mapcar*.  3maplist*
is like 3mapcar* except that the function is applied to the list and
successive cdr's of that list rather than to successive elements of the
list.  3map* and 3mapc* are like 3maplist* and 3mapcar*
respectively, except that they don't return any useful value.  These
functions are used when the function is being called merely for its
side-effects, rather than its returned values.  3mapcan* and
3mapcon* are like 3mapcar* and 3maplist* respectively, except
that they combine the results of the function using 3nconc* instead
of 3list*.  That is,
.lisp
(defun mapcon (f x y)
    (apply 'nconc (maplist f x y)))
.end_lisp
Of course, this definition is less general than the real one.

Sometimes a 3do* or a straightforward recursion is preferable to a
map;  however, the mapping functions should be used wherever they
naturally apply because this increases the clarity of the code. 

Often 2f* will be a lambda-expression, rather than a symbol;
for example,
.lisp
(mapcar (function (lambda (x) (cons x something)))
	some-list)
.end_lisp

The functional argument to a mapping function must be acceptable
to 3apply* - it cannot be a macro or the name of a special form.
Of course, there is nothing wrong with using functions which have optional
and rest parameters.
