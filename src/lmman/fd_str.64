.chapter "Strings"
.cindex string
	Strings are a type of array which are constants (they self-evaluate)
and have as their printed representation a sequence of characters enclosed
in quote marks, for example 3"foo bar"*.  Strings are the right data type
to use for text-processing.
	The functions described in this section provide a variety of
useful operations on strings.  Several of the functions actually work
on any type of 1-dimensional array and may be useful for other than string processing.
3art-16b* arrays (arrays of 16-bit positive numbers) are often used
as strings; the extra bits allow for an expanded character set.
	In place of a string, most of these functions will accept a symbol or a fixnum
as an argument, and will coerce it into a string.  Given a symbol, its print name,
which is a string, will be used.  Given a fixnum, a 1 character long string
containing the character designated by that fixnum will be used.
	Note that the length of a string is computed using 3array-active-length*,
so that if a string has an array-leader, element 0 of the leader (called the
2fill pointer*) will be taken as the length.

	Since strings are arrays, the usual array-referencing function 3aref*
is used to extract the characters of the string as fixnums.  For example,
.lisp
(aref "frob" 1) => 162  1;lower-case r*
.end_lisp
It is also legal to store into strings (using 3aset*).
As with 3rplaca* on lists, this changes the actual object; one must be careful
to understand where side-effects will propagate to.

.section "String Manipulation"

.defun character x
	3character* coerces 2x* to a single character,
represented as a fixnum.  If 2x* is a number, it is returned.  If
2x* is a string or an array, its first element is returned.  If
2x* is a symbol, the first character of its pname is returned.
Otherwise, an error occurs.
.end_defun

.defun char-equal ch1 ch2
	This is the primitive for comparing characters for equality;
many of the string functions call it.  2ch1* and 2ch2*
must be fixnums.  The result is 3t* if the characters are equal ignoring
case and font, otherwise 3nil*.
3%%ch-char* is the byte-specifier for the portion of a character
which excludes the font information.
.end_defun

.defun char-lessp ch1 ch2
	This is the primitive for comparing characters for order;
many of the string functions call it.  2ch1* and 2ch2*
must be fixnums.  The result is 3t* if 2ch1* comes before 2ch2*
ignoring case and font, otherwise 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defvar alphabetic-case-affects-string-comparison
This variable is normally 3nil*.  If it is 3t*, 3char-equal*,
3char-lessp*, and the string searching and comparison functions will
distinguish between upper-case and lower-case letters.  It is alright
to bind this to 3t*, but changing its global value to 3t* will
break many system functions and user interfaces and so is not recommended.
.end_defvar

.defun string x
	3string* coerces 2x* into a string.  Most of the string
functions apply this to their string arguments.
If 2x* is a string or an array, it is returned.  If 2x* is
a symbol, its pname is returned.  If 2x* is a number, a 1-character
long string containing it is returned.  Otherwise, an error occurs.
.end_defun

.defun string-length string
	3string-length* returns the number of characters in 2string*.  This is 1
if 2string* is a number, the 3array-active-length*
(see (array-active-length-fun))
if 2string*
is an array, or the 3array-active-length* of the pname if 2string* is a symbol.
.end_defun

.defun string-equal string1 string2 &optional (idx1 0) (idx2 0) lim1 lim2
	3string-equal* compares two strings, returning 3t* if
they are equal and 3nil* if they are not.  The comparison ignores
the extra "font" bits in 16-bit strings
and ignores alphabetic case.  3equal* calls 3string-equal* if
applied to two strings.
	The optional arguments 2idx1* and 2idx2* are the starting
indices into the strings.  The optional arguments 2lim1* and 2lim2*
are the final indices; the comparison stops just 2before* the final index.
2lim1* and 2lim2* default to the lengths of the strings.  These arguments are provided
so that you can efficiently compare substrings.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(string-equal "Foo" "foo") => t
(string-equal "foo" "bar") => nil
(string-equal "element" "select" 0 1 3 4) => t
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun %string-equal string1 idx1 string2 idx2 count
3%string-equal* is the microcode primitive which 3string-equal* calls.
It returns 3t* if the 2count* characters of 2string1* starting
at 2idx1* are 3char-equal* to the 2count* characters of 2string2*
starting at 2idx2*, or 3nil* if the characters are not equal or
if 2count* runs off the length of either array.

Instead of a fixnum, 2count* may also be 3nil*.  In this case,
3%string-equal* compares
the substring from 2idx1* to 3(string-length 2string1*)*
against the substring from 2idx2* to 3(string-length 2string2*)*.
If the lengths of these substrings differ, then they are not equal and
3nil* is returned.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
1To compare the two strings 2foo* and 2bar*:*
(%string-equal 2foo* 0 2bar* nil)
1To see if the string 2foo* starts with the characters 3"bar"*:*
(%string-equal 2foo* 0 "bar" 0 3)
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-lessp string1 string2
	3string-lessp* compares two strings using dictionary order.
The result is 3t* if 2string1* is the lesser, and 3nil*
if they are equal or 2string2* is the lesser.
.end_defun

.defun substring string start &optional end area
	This extracts a substring of 2string*, starting at the
character specified by 2start* and going up to but not including
the character specified by 2end*.  2start* and 2end* are
0-origin indices.  The length of the returned string is 2end* minus
2start*.  If 2end* is not specified it defaults to the length
of 2string*.  The area in which the result is to be consed may be
optionally specified.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(substring "Nebuchadnezzar" 4 8) => "chad"
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun nsubstring string start &optional end area
3nsubstring* is the same as 3substring* except that the substring
is not copied; instead an indirect array (see (indirect-array)) is created which shares part
of the argument 2string*.  Modifying one string will modify the other.

Note that 3nsubstring* does not necessarily use less storage than
3substring*; an 3nsubstring* of any length uses the same amount of
storage as a 3substring* 12 characters long.
.end_defun

.defun string-append &rest strings
Any number of strings are copied and concatenated into a single string.
With a single argument, 3string-append* simply copies it.
If the first argument is an array, the result will be an array of the same type.
Thus 3string-append* can be
used to copy and concatenate any type of 1-dimensional array.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-append 41 "foo" 41) => "!foo!"
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-trim char-list string
	This returns a 3substring* of 2string*, with all characters
in 2char-list* stripped off of the beginning and end.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-trim '(40) "  Dr. No  ") => "Dr. No"
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-left-trim char-list string
	This returns a 3substring* of 2string*, with all characters
in 2char-list* stripped off of the beginning.
.end_defun

.defun string-right-trim char-list string
	This returns a 3substring* of 2string*, with all characters
in 2char-list* stripped off of the end.
.end_defun

.defun char-upcase ch
	If 2ch*, which must be a fixnum, is a lower-case alphabetic
character its upper-case form is returned; otherwise, 2ch* itself is
returned.  If font information is present it is preserved.
.end_defun

.defun char-downcase ch
	If 2ch*, which must be a fixnum, is a upper-case alphabetic
character its lower-case form is returned; otherwise, 2ch* itself is
returned.  If font information is present it is preserved.
.end_defun

.defun string-upcase string
	Returns a copy of 2string*, with all lower case alphabetic
characters replaced by the corresponding upper case characters.
.end_defun

.defun string-downcase string
	Returns a copy of 2string*, with all upper case alphabetic
characters replaced by the corresponding lower case characters.
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse string
	Returns a copy of 2string* with the order of characters reversed.
This will reverse a 1-dimensional array of any type.
.end_defun

.defun string-nreverse string
	Returns 2string* with the order of characters reversed,
smashing the original string, rather than creating a new one.
If 2string* is a number, it is simply
returned without consing up a string.
This will reverse a 1-dimensional array of any type.
.end_defun

.defun string-search-char char string &optional (from 0) to
3string-search-char* searches through 2string* starting at the index 2from*,
which defaults to the beginning, and returns the index of the first
character which is 3char-equal* to 2char*, or 3nil* if none is found.
If the 2to* argument is supplied, it is used in place of 3(string-length 2string*)*
to limit the extent of the search.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-search-char 101 "banana") => 1
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun %string-search-char char string from to
3%string-search-char* is the microcode primitive which 3string-search-char*
and other functions call.  2string* must be an array and 2char*, 2from*,
and 2to* must be fixnums.  Except for this lack of type-coercion, and the fact
that none of the arguments is optional, 3%string-search-char* is the same as
3string-search-char*.
.end_defun

.defun string-search-not-char char string &optional (from 0) to
3string-search-not-char* searches through 2string* starting at the index 2from*,
which defaults to the beginning, and returns the index of the first
character which is 2not* 3char-equal* to 2char*, or 3nil* if none is found.
If the 2to* argument is supplied, it is used in place of 3(string-length 2string*)*
to limit the extent of the search.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-search-char 102 "banana") => 1
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-search key string &optional (from 0) to
3string-search* searches for the string 2key* in the string
2string*.  The search begins at 2from*, which defaults to the
beginning of 2string*.  The value returned is the index of the first
character of the first instance of 2key*, or 3nil* if none is
found.
If the 2to* argument is supplied, it is used in place of 3(string-length 2string*)*
to limit the extent of the search.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-search "an" "banana") => 1
(string-search "an" "banana" 2) => 3
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-search-set char-list string &optional (from 0) to
3string-search-set* searches through 2string* looking for
a character which is in 2char-list*.  The search begins at the index 2from*,
which defaults to the beginning.  It returns the index of the first
character which is 3char-equal* to some element of 2char-list*,
or 3nil* if none is found.
If the 2to* argument is supplied, it is used in place of 3(string-length 2string*)*
to limit the extent of the search.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-search-set '(116 117) "banana") => 2
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-search-not-set char-list string &optional (from 0) to
3string-search-not-set* searches through 2string* looking for
a character which is not in 2char-list*.  The search begins at the index 2from*,
which defaults to the beginning.  It returns the index of the first
character which is not 3char-equal* to any element of 2char-list*,
or 3nil* if none is found.
If the 2to* argument is supplied, it is used in place of 3(string-length 2string*)*
to limit the extent of the search.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-search-not-set '(141 142) "banana") => 2
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse-search-char char string &optional from (to 0)
3string-reverse-search-char* searches through 2string* in reverse order, starting
from the index one less than 2from*, which defaults to the length of 2string*,
and returns the index of the first character which is 3char-equal*
to 2char*, or 3nil* if none is found.  Note that the index returned
is from the beginning of the string, although the search starts from the end.
If the 2to* argument is supplied, it limits the extent of the search.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(string-reverse-search-char 156 "banana") => 4
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse-search-not-char char string &optional from (to 0)
3string-reverse-search-not-char* searches through 2string* in reverse order, starting
from the index one less than 2from*, which defaults to the length of 2string*,
and returns the index of the first character which is 2not* 3char-equal*
to 2char*, or 3nil* if none is found.  Note that the index returned
is from the beginning of the string, although the search starts from the end.
If the 2to* argument is supplied, it limits the extent of the search.

(string-reverse-search-not-char 101 "banana") => 4
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun string-reverse-search key string &optional from (to 0)
3string-reverse-search* searches for the string 2key* in the string 2string*.
The search proceeds in reverse order, starting
from the index one less than 2from*, which defaults to the length of 2string*,
and returns the index of the first (leftmost) character of the first instance found,
or 3nil* if none is found.  Note that the index returned
is from the beginning of the string, although the search starts from the end.
The 2from* condition, restated, is that the instance of 2key* found
is the rightmost one whose rightmost character is before the 2from*'th character
of 2string*.
If the 2to* argument is supplied, it limits the extent of the search.

See also 3intern* ((intern-fun)), which given a string will return "the" symbol
with that print name.

.section "Maclisp-compatible Functions"

.defun alphalessp string1 string2
3(alphalessp 2string1 string2*)* is equivalent to
3(string-lessp 2string1 string2*)*.
.end_defun

.defun getchar string index
	Returns the 2index*'th character of 2string*
as a symbol.  Note that 1-origin indexing is used.  This function
is mainly for Maclisp compatibility; 3aref* should be used
to index into strings (however 3aref* will not coerce symbols
or numbers into strings).
.end_defun

.defun getcharn string index
	Returns the 2index*'th character of 2string*
as a fixnum.  Note that 1-origin indexing is used.  This function
is mainly for Maclisp compatibility; 3aref* should be used
to index into strings (however 3aref* will not coerce symbols
or numbers into strings).
.end_defun

.defun ascii x
	3ascii* is like 3character*, but returns a symbol
whose printname is the character instead of returning a fixnum.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(ascii 101) => A
(ascii 56) => /.
.end_lisp
The symbol returned is interned in the 3user* package.
.end_defun

.defun maknam char-list
	3maknam* returns
an uninterned symbol whose print-name is a string made up of the characters in 2char-list*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(maknam '(a b 60 d)) => ab0d
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun implode char-list
	3implode* is like 3maknam* except that the returned symbol
is interned in the current package.
.end_defun

	The 3samepnamep* function is also provided; see (samepnamep-fun).

.section "Formatted Output"
.cindex formatted output
.c Should grind be in here?

.defun format destination control-string &rest args
3format* is used to produce formatted output.
3format* outputs the characters of 2control-string*, except
that a tilde ("~") introduces a directive.  The character after
the tilde, possibly preceded by arguments and modifiers, specifies
what kind of formatting is desired.  Some directives use one or more
elements of 2args* to create their output.

	The output is sent to 2destination*.  If 2destination* is
3nil*, a string is created which contains the output; this string is
returned as the value of the call to 3format*.  If 2destination* is
a stream, the output is sent to it.  If 2destination* is 3t*, the
output is sent to 3standard-output*.  If 2destination* is a string
with an array-leader, such as would be acceptable to 3string-nconc*,
the output is added to the end of that string. 

	A directive consists of a tilde, optional decimal numeric parameters
separated by commas, optional colon ("3:*") and atsign ("3@*") modifiers,
and a single character indicating what kind of directive this is.
The alphabetic case of the character is ignored.
Examples of control strings:
.lisp
"~S"        ; 1This is an S directive with no parameters.*
"~3,4:@s"   ; 1This is an S directive with two parameters, 3 and 4,*
            ; 1   and both the colon and atsign flags.*
.end_lisp

	Sometimes a numeric parameter is used to specify a character,
for instance the padding character in a right- or left-justifying
operation.  In this case a single quote ("3'*") followed by the
desired character may be used as a numeric argument.  For example,
you can use
.lisp
"~5,'0d"
.end_lisp
to print a decimal number in five columns with leading zeros.

	The kinds of directives will now be described.
2arg* will be used to refer to the next argument from 2args*.
.table 3
.item ~D
2arg*, a number, is printed as a decimal integer.
3~2n*D* uses a column width of 2n*; spaces are inserted on
the left if the number requires less than 2n* columns for its digits
and sign.  If the number doesn't fit in 2n* columns, additional columns
are used as needed. 3~2n*,2m*D* uses 2m* as the pad character
instead of 40 (space).  If 2arg* is not a number, it is printed
in 3~A* format.
The 3@* modifier causes the number's sign to be printed always; the default
is only to print it if the number is negative.
The 3:* modifier causes commas to be printed between groups of three digits;
the third numeric parameter may be used to change the character used as the comma.
Thus the most general form of 3~D* is 3~2mincol*,2padchar*,2commachar*D*.
.item ~O
This is just like 3~D* but prints in octal instead of decimal.

.item ~F
2arg* is printed in floating point.  3~2n*F* rounds 2arg* to a precision
of 2n* digits.  The minimum value of 2n* is 2, since a decimal point is
always printed.  If the magnitude of 2arg* is too large or too small, it is printed
in exponential notation.  If 2arg* is not a number, it is printed in
3~A* format.

.item ~E
2arg* is printed in exponential notation.  This is identical to 3~F*,
including the use of a numeric parameter to specify the number of digits,
except that the number is always printed with a trailing exponent,
even if it is within a reasonable range.

.item ~A
2arg*, any Lisp object, is printed without slashification (like 3princ*).
3~:A* prints 3()* if 2arg* is 3nil*; this is useful when printing
something that is always supposed to be a list.
3~2n*A* inserts spaces on the right, if necessary, to make the
column width at least 2n*.  The 3@* modifier causes the spaces
to be inserted on the left rather than the right.
3~2mincol,colinc,minpad,padchar*A* is the full form of 3~A*,
which allows elaborate control of the padding.
The string is padded on the right with at least 2minpad* copies
of 2padchar*; padding characters are then inserted 2colinc* characters
at a time until the total width is at least 2mincol*.
The defaults are 0 for 2mincol* and 2minpad*, 1 for 2colinc*,
and space for 2padchar*.

.item ~S
This is just like 3~A*, but 2arg* is printed 2with* slashification
(like 3prin1* rather than 3princ*).

.item ~C
3(character 2arg*)* is printed as a keyboard character (see (%%kbd)).
Any control bits are printed first by representing them with Greek letters:
alpha (Control), beta (Meta), epsilon (Control and Meta),
lambda (Hyper), pi (Super).
If the character itself is alpha, beta, epsilon, lambda, pi, or equivalence-sign,
then it is preceded by an equivalence-sign to quote it.

With the colon flag (3~:C*), the name of the control bits are spelled out
(e.g. "3Control-Meta-F*"), and also non-printing characters (those in the 200 to 377 range)
are represented by their names (e.g. "3Return*").

With both colon and atsign (3~:@C*), the colon-only format is printed, and then
if the character requires the Top, Front, or Greek key(s) to type it,
this fact is mentioned (e.g. "3 (Top-L)*").

For all three of these formats,
if the character is not a keyboard character but a mouse "character",
it is printed as "Mouse-", the name of the button, "-", and the number of clicks.

With just an atsign (3~@C*), the character is printed in such a way that
the READ function can understand it, using "3#/*" or "3#\*".

Examples:
.lisp
(setq a `(44 1440 403 215 611 ,(dpb 1 %%kbd-mouse 11)))
(format nil "~{<~C>~}" a)  =>
  "<$>< ><><
><	><Mouse-Middle-Twice>"
(format nil "~{<~:C>~}" a)  =>
  "<$><Control-Meta-Space><Control-><Return><Control-Tab><Mouse-Middle-Twice>"
(format nil "~{<~:@C>~}" a)  =>
  "<$><Control-Meta-Space><Control- (Top-X)><Return><Control-Tab><Mouse-Middle-Twice>"
(format nil "~{<~@C>~}" a)  =>
  "<#//$><#\SPACE><#//><#\RETURN><#\TAB><#\MOUSE-M-2>"
.end_lisp

.item ~%
Outputs a newline.  3~2n*%* outputs 2n* newlines.
No argument is used.

.item ~&
The 3:fresh-line* operation is performed on the output stream.
Unless the stream knows that it is already at the front of a line,
this outputs a newline.  3~2n*&* does a 3:fresh-line* operation
and then outputs 2n-1* newlines.

.item ~|
Outputs a formfeed.  3~2n*|* outputs 2n* formfeeds.  With a 3:*,
performs a 3:clear-screen* operation on the output stream if the stream
supports that operation; otherwise it behaves as if no 3:* were present
(outputs formfeed(s)).

.item ~X
Outputs a space.  3~2n*X* outputs 2n* spaces.

.item ~~
Outputs a tilde.  3~2n*~* outputs 2n* tildes.

.item ~ <CR>
Tilde immediately followed by a carriage return ignores the carriage return
and any whitespace at the beginning of the next line.  With a 3:*, the whitespace
is left in place.  With an 3@*, the carriage return is left in place.

.item ~*
2arg* is ignored.  3~2n*** ignores the next 2n* arguments.
3~:** "ignores backwards"; that is, it backs up in the list
of arguments so that the argument last processed will be processed
again.  3~:2n*** backs up 2n* arguments.
When within a 3~{* construct, the ignoring (in either direction)
is relative to the list of arguments being processed by the iteration.

.item ~P
If 2arg* is not 31*, a lower-case s is printed.  ("P" for "plural".)
3~:P* does the same thing, after doing a 3~:**; that is, it prints
a lower-case s if the 2last* argument was not 1.  3~@P* prints "y"
if the argument is 1, or "ies" if it is not.  3~:@P* does the same thing,
but backs up first.

.item ~T
.setq format-t-operation page
Spaces over to a given column.  3~2n*,2m*T* will output
sufficient spaces to move the cursor to column 2n*.  If the cursor
is already past column 2n*, it will output spaces to move it to
column 2n*+2mk*, for the smallest integer value 2k* possible.
2n* and 2m* default to 31*.  Without the colon flag, 2n* and
2m* are in units of characters; with it, they are in units of pixels.
2Note*: this operation 2only* works properly on streams that support
the 3:read-cursorpos* and 3:set-cursorpos* stream operations
(see (read-cursorpos)).  On other streams (and when 3format* is creating
a string), any 3~T* operation will simply output two spaces.

.item ~R
If there is no parameter, then 2arg* is printed as a cardinal English number, e.g. four.
With the colon modifier, 2arg* is printed as an ordinal number, e.g. fourth.
With the atsign modifier, 2arg* is printed as a Roman numeral, e.g. IV.
With both atsign and colon, 2arg* is printed as an old Roman numeral, e.g. IIII.

If there is a parameter, then it is the radix in which to print the number.
The flags and any remaining parameters are used as for the 3~D* directive.
Indeed, 3~D* is the same as 3~10R*.  The full form here is therefore
3~2radix*,2mincol*,2padchar*,2commachar*R*.

.item ~2n*G
"Goes to" the 2n*th argument.  3~0G* goes back to the
first argument in 2args*.  Directives after a 3~2n*G*
will take sequential arguments after the one gone to.
When within a 3~{* construct, the "goto"
is relative to the list of arguments being processed by the iteration.
This is an "absolute goto"; for a "relative goto", see 3~**.

.item ~[2str0*~;2str1*~;2...*~;2strn*~]
This is a set of alternative control strings.  The alternatives
(called 2clauses*)
are separated by 3~;* and the construct is terminated by 3~]*.
For example, "3~[Siamese ~;Manx ~;Persian ~;Tortoise-Shell ~;Tiger
~;Yu-Hsiang ~]kitty*".  The 2arg*th
alternative is selected; 30* selects the first.
If a numeric parameter is given (i.e. 3~2n*[*),
then the parameter is used instead of an argument
(this is useful only if the parameter is "3#*").
If 2arg* is out of range no alternative is selected.
After the selected alternative has been processed, the control string
continues after the 3~]*.

~[2str0*~;2str1*~;2...*~;2strn*~:;2default*~] has a default case.
If the 2last* 3~;* used to separate clauses
is instead 3~:;*, then the last clause is an "else" clause,
which is performed if no other clause is selected.
For example, "3~[Siamese ~;Manx ~;Persian ~;Tortoise-Shell ~;Tiger
~;Yu-Hsiang ~:;Unknown ~] kitty*".

~[~2tag00*,2tag01*,2...*;2str0*~2tag10*,2...*;2str1...*~]
allows the clauses to have explicit tags.  The parameters to each 3~;*
are numeric tags for the clause which follows it.  That clause is processed
which has a tag matching the argument.  If 3~:2a1*,2a2*,2b1*,2b2*,2...*;*
is used, then the following clause is tagged not by single values but
by ranges of values 2a1* through 2a2* (inclusive), 2b1* through 2b2*, etc.
3~:;* with no parameters may be used at the end to denote a default clause.
For example, "3~[~'+,'-,'*,'//;operator ~'A,'Z,'a,'z;letter ~'0,'9;digit ~:;other ~]*".

3~:[2false*~;2true*~]* selects the 2false* control string
if 2arg* is 3nil*, and selects the 2true* control string otherwise.

3~@[2true*~]* tests the argument.  If it is not 3nil*,
then the argument is not used up, but is the next one to be processed,
and the one clause is processed.
If it is 3nil*, then the argument is used up, and the clause is not processed.
.lisp

   =>  " PRINLENGTH=5"
.end_lisp

.item ~;
Separates clauses in 3~[* and 3~<* constructions.  It is undefined elsewhere.

.item ~]
Terminates a 3~[*.  It is undefined elsewhere.
.end_table

.item ~{2str*~}
This is an iteration construct.  The argument should be a list,
which is used as a set of arguments as if for a recursive call to 3format*.
The string 2str* is used repeatedly as the control string.
Each iteration can absorb as many elements of the list as it likes.
If before any iteration step the list is empty, then the iteration is terminated.
Also, if a numeric parameter 2n* is given, then there will be at most 2n*
repetitions of processing of 2str*.

3~:{2str*~}* is similar, but the argument should be a list of sublists.
At each repetition step one sublist is used as the set of arguments for
processing 2str*; on the next repetition a new sublist is used, whether
or not all of the last sublist had been processed.

3~@{2str*~}* is similar to 3~{2str*~}*, but instead of
using one argument which is a list, all the remaining arguments
are used as the list of arguments for the iteration.

3~:@{2str*~}* combines the features of 3~:{2str*~}* and 3~@{2str*~}*.
All the remaining arguments
are used, and each one must be a list.
On each iteration one argument is used as a list of arguments.

Terminating the repetition construct with 3~:}* instead of 3~}*
forces 2str* to be processed at least once even if the initial
list of arguments is null (however, it will not override an explicit
numeric parameter of zero).

If 2str* is null, then an argument is used as 2str*.  It must be a string,
and precedes any arguments processed by the iteration.  As an example,
the following are equivalent:
.lisp
(apply (function format) (list* stream string args))
(format stream "~1{~:}" string args)
.end_lisp
This will use 3string* as a formatting string.  The 3~1{* says it will
be processed at most once, and the 3~:}* says it will be processed at least once.
Therefore it is processed exactly once, using 3args* as the arguments.
As another example, the 3format* function itself uses 3format-error*
(a routine internal to the 3format* package) to signal
error messages, which in turn uses 3ferror*, which uses 3format* recursively.  
Now 3format-error* takes a string and arguments, just like 3format*,
but also prints some addtitional information: if the control string in 3ctl-string*
actually is a string (it might be a list -- see below), then it prints the string
and a little arrow showing where in the processing of the control string the
error occurred.  The variable 3ctl-index* points one character after the place of
the error.
.lisp
(DEFUN FORMAT-ERROR (STRING &REST ARGS)
       (COND ((STRINGP CTL-STRING)
	      (FERROR NIL "~1{~:}~%~VT~%~3X/"~A/"~%"
		      STRING ARGS (+ CTL-INDEX 3) CTL-STRING))
	     (T (FERROR NIL "~1{~:}" STRING ARGS))))
.end_lisp
This first processes the given string and arguments using 3~1{~:}*, then
tabs a variable amount for printing the down-arrow, then prints the control
string between double-quotes.  The effect is something like this:
.lisp
(format t "The item is a ~[Foo~;Bar~;Loser~]." 'quux)
>>ERROR: The argument to the FORMAT "~[" command must be a number
                   
   "The item is a ~[Foo~;Bar~;Loser~]."
...
.end_lisp

.item ~}
Terminates a 3~{*.  It is undefined elsewhere.
.end_table

.item ~^
This is an escape construct.  If there are no more arguments remaining
to be processed, then the immediately enclosing 3~{* or 3~<* construct
is terminated.  (In the latter case, the 3~< formatting 2is* performed, but no
more clauses are processed before doing the justification.
The 3~^* should appear only at the 2beginning* of a 3~<* clause,
because it aborts the entire clause.  It may appear anywhere in a 3~{* construct.)
If there is no such enclosing construct, then the entire formatting operation
is terminated.

If a numeric parameter is given, then termination occurs if the parameter
is zero.  (Hence 3~^* is the same as 3~#^*.)  If two parameters are
given, termination occurs if they are equal.  If three are given, termination
occurs if the second is between the other two in ascending order.

If 3~^* is used within a 3~:{* construct, then it merely terminates
the current iteration step (because in the standard case it tests for
remaining arguments of the current step only); the next iteration step
commences immediately.  To terminate the entire iteration process,
use 3~:^*.

.item ~<
3~2mincol*,2colinc*,2minpad*,2padchar*<2text*~>*
justifies 2text* within a field 2mincol* wide.  2Text*
may be divided up into clauses with 3~;*--the
spacing is evenly divided between the text segments.
With no modifiers, the leftmost text segment is left justified in the
field, and the rightmost text segment right justified;  if there is
only one, as a special case, it is right justified.
The colon modifier causes
spacing to be introduced before the first text segment;  the atsign
modifier causes spacing to be added after the last.
2Minpad*, default 30*, is the minimum number of 2padchar*
(default space) padding characters to be output between each segment.
If the total width needed to satisfy these constraints is greater
than 2mincol*, then 2mincol* is adjusted upwards in
2colinc* increments.  2Colinc* defaults to 21*.
.lisp
(format nil "~10<foo~;bar~>")    =>  "foo    bar"
(format nil "~10:<foo~;bar~>")   =>  "  foo  bar"
(format nil "~10:@<foo~;bar~>")  =>  "  foo bar "
(format nil "~10<foobar~>")      =>  "    foobar"
(format nil "$~10,,'*<~3f~>" 2.59023)  =>  "$******2.59"
.end_lisp

If 3~^* is used within a 3~<* construct, then only the clauses
which were completely processed are used.  For example:
.lisp
(format nil "~15<~S~;~^~S~;~^~S~>" 'foo)            =>  "            FOO"
(format nil "~15<~S~;~^~S~;~^~S~>" 'foo 'bar)       =>  "BAR         FOO"
(format nil "~15<~S~;~^~S~;~^~S~>" 'foo 'bar 'baz)  =>  "FOO   BAR   BAZ"
.end_lisp

If the first clause of a 3~<* is terminated with 3~:;* instead of 3~;*,
then it is used in a special way.  All of the clauses are processed
(subject to 3~^*, of course), but the first one is omitted in
performing the spacing and padding.  When the padded result has been
determined, then if it will fit on the current line of output, it is output,
and the text for the first clause is discarded.  If, however, the padded text
will not fit on the current line, then a newline is output, then the
text for the first clause, then the padded text.  The first clause is
always processed, and so any arguments it refers to will be used;
the decision is whether to use the resulting piece of text, not whether to
process the first clause.  If the 3~:;* has a numeric parameter 2n*, then
the padded text must fit on the current line with 2n* character positions to spare
to avoid outputting the newline.
For example, the control string 3"~%;; ~{~<;; ~:1; ~S~>~^,~}.~%"* can be used to
print a list of items separated by commas, without breaking items over line boundaries,
and beginning each line with "3;; *".  The argument 1 in 3~:1;* accounts
for the width of the comma which will follow the justified item if it is not the last
element in the list.  If 3~:;* has a second numeric parameter 2m*,
then 2m* is used as the width of the line, thus overriding the natural line
width of the output stream.  To make the preceding example use a line width of 50,
one would write 3"~%;; ~{~<;; ~:1,30; ~S~>~^,~}.~%"*.

.item ~>
Terminates a 3~<*.  It is undefined elsewhere.
.end_table

In place of a numeric parameter to a directive, you can put the letter
V, which takes an argument from 2args* as a parameter to the
directive.  Normally this should be a number but it doesn't really have
to be.  This feature allows variable column-widths and the like.  Also,
you can use the character # in place of a parameter; it represents the
number of arguments remaining to be processed.  This is useful, for
example, for dealing with English conventions for printing lists:
.lisp
(setq foo "Items:~#[ none~; ~S~; ~S and ~S~:;~@{~#[~1; and~] ~S~^,~}~].")
(format nil foo)  =>  "Items: none."
(format nil foo 'foo)  =>  "Items: FOO."
(format nil foo 'foo 'bar)  =>  "Items: FOO and BAR."
(format nil foo 'foo 'bar 'baz)  =>  "Items: FOO, BAR, and BAZ."
(format nil foo 'foo 'bar 'baz 'quux)  =>  "Items: FOO, BAR, BAZ, and QUUX."
.end_lisp


	The user can define his own directives.  How to do this is not documented
here; read the code.  Names of user-defined directives longer than one character
may be used if they are enclosed in backslashes (e.g. 3~4,3\GRAPH\*).

.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(format nil "foo") => "foo"
(setq x 5)
(format nil "The answer is ~D." x) => "The answer is 5."
(format nil "The answer is ~3D." x) => "The answer is   5."
(setq y "elephant")
(format nil "Look at the ~A!" y) => "Look at the elephant!"
(format nil "The character ~:@C is strange." 1003)
      => "The character Meta- (Top-X) is strange."
(setq n 3)
(format nil "~D item~P found." n n) => "3 items found."
(format nil "~R dog~:[s are~; is~] here." n (= n 1))
      => "three dogs are here."
(format nil "~R dog~[~1; is~:;s are~] here." n)
      => "three dogs are here."
(format nil "Here ~[~1;is~:;are~] ~:*~R pupp~:P." n)
      => "Here are three puppies."
.end_lisp

3format* also allows 2control-string* to be a list of strings
and lists, which is processed from left to right.  Strings are interpreted
as in the simple case.  Lists are taken as extended directives; the first
element is the directive letter, and the remaining elements are the numeric
parameters to the directive.  If the
car of a list is not a recognized directive, the list is simply evaluated
as a form; anything it writes to the 3standard-output* stream will
appear in the result of 3format*.
.end_defun

.defun format:print-list destination element-format list &optional separator start-line options
This function provides a simpler interface for the specific
purpose of printing comma-separated lists with no list element
split across two lines.  2destination* tells where to send the output;
it can be 3t*, 3nil*, or a stream, as with 3format*.
2element-format* is a format-control-string which tells how
to print each element of 2list*; it is used as the body of a 3"~{...~}"* construct.
2separator*, which defaults to 3", "* (comma, space) is a string which goes after
each element except the last.  Format-control commands are not recommended in 2separator*.
2start-line*, which defaults to three spaces, is a format-control-string which
is used as a prefix at the beginning of each line of output, except the first.
Format-control commands are allowed in 2separator*, but they should not swallow
arguments from 2list*.  2options* is a string inserted before the opening 3"{"*;
it defaults to the null string, but allows you to insert colon and/or atsign.
