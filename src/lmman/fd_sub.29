.chapter "Subprimitives"
.cindex subprimitives
	Subprimitives are functions which are not intended to be used by
the average program, only by "system programs".  They allow one to
manipulate the environment at a level lower than normal Lisp.
Subprimitives usually have names which start with a 3%* character.
The "primitives" described in other sections of the manual typically
use subprimitives to accomplish their work.  The subprimitives take
the place of machine language in other systems, to some extent.
Subprimitives are normally hand-coded in microcode.
	Subprimitives by their very nature cannot do full checking.
Improper use of subprimitives can destroy the environment.

.section "Data Types"

.defun data-type arg
3data-type* returns a symbol which is the name
for the internal data-type of the "pointer" which represents 2arg*.
Note that some types as seen by the user are not distinguished from each other
at this level, and some user types may be represented by more than one
internal type.

.table 3
.item si:dtp-symbol
The object is a symbol.
.item si:dtp-fix
The object is a fixnum; the numeric value is contained immediately in the pointer field.
.item si:dtp-small-flonum
The object is an immediate small floating-point number.
.item si:dtp-extended-number
The object is a flonum or a bignum.  This value will be used for future numeric
types.
.item si:dtp-list
The object is a cons.
.item si:dtp-locative
The object is a locative pointer.
.item si:dtp-array-pointer
The object is an array.
.item si:dtp-fef-pointer
The object is a fef.
.item si:dtp-u-entry
The object is a microcode entry.
.item si:dtp-closure
The object is a closure.
.item si:dtp-stack-group
The object is a stack-group.
.item si:dtp-instance
The object is an "active object".  These are not documented yet.
.item si:dtp-entity
The same as 3dtp-closure* except it is a kind of "active object".
These are not documented yet.
.item si:dtp-select-method
Another type associated with "active objects" and not documented yet.
.item si:dtp-header
An internal type used to mark the first word of a multi-word structure.
.item si:dtp-array-header
An internal type used in arrays.
.item si:dtp-symbol-header
An internal type used to mark the first word of a symbol.
.item si:dtp-instance-header
An internal type used to mark the first word of an instance.
.item si:dtp-null
Nothing to do with 3nil*.  This is used in unbound value and function cells.
.item si:dtp-trap
The zero data-type, which is not used.  This hopes to detect microcode errors.
.item si:dtp-free
This type is used to fill free storage, to catch wild references.
.item si:dtp-external-value-cell-pointer
An "invisible pointer" used for external value cells,
which are part of the closure mechanism (see (closure)).
and used by compiled code to address value and function cells.
.item si:dtp-header-forward
An "invisible pointer" used to indicate that the structure containing
it has been moved elsewhere.  The "header word" of the structure is
replaced by one of these invisible pointers.  See the function 3structure-forward*
((structure-forward-fun)).
.item si:dtp-body-forward
An "invisible pointer" used to indicate that the structure containing
it has been moved elsewhere.  This points to the word containing
the header-forward, which points to the new copy of the structure.
.item si:dtp-one-q-forward
An "invisible pointer" used to indicate that the single cell containing
it has been moved elsewhere.
.item si:dtp-gc-forward
This is used by the copying garbage collector to flag old objects that
have already been copied.
.end_table
.end_defun

.defvar q-data-types
The value of 3q-data-types* is a list of all of the symbolic
names for data types described above under 3data-type*.
(the symbols whose print names begin
with "3dtp-*")
.end_defvar

.defun q-data-types type-code
An array, indexed by the internal numeric data-type code,
which contains the corresponding symbolic names.
.end_defun

.section "Creating Objects"

.defun make-list area size
	This function makes a cdr-coded list of 3nil*s of a
specified length in a specified area.
2area* is which area to create it in, which may be either a fixnum
or a symbol whose value will be used.  2size* is the number
of words to be allocated.  Each word has cdr code 2cdr-next*,
except for the last which has 2cdr-nil*.
	This function is to be used only for making lists.  If
making a "structure" (any data type that has a header), use one
of the two functions below.  This is because the two classes of object
must be created in different storage regions, for the sake of
system storage conventions and the garbage collector.
.end_defun

.defun %allocate-and-initialize data-type header-type header second-word area size
	This is the subprimitive for creating most structured-type objects.
2area* is the area in which it is to be created, as a fixnum or a symbol.
2size* is the number of words to be allocated.  The value returned
points to the first word allocated, and has data-type 2data-type*.
Uninterruptibly, the words allocated are initialized so that storage
conventions are preserved at all times.  The first word, the header,
is initialized to have 2header-type* in its data-type field 
and 2header* in its pointer field.  The second word is initialized
to 2second-word*.  The remaining words are initialized to 3nil*.
The cdr codes are initialized as in 3make-list*, currently.
.end_defun

.defun %allocate-and-initialize-array header data-length leader-length area size
	This is the subprimitive for creating arrays, called only by 3make-array*.
It is different from 3%allocate-and-initialize* because arrays have
a more complicated header structure.
.end_defun

.defun structure-forward old-object new-object
This causes references to 2old-object* to actually reference
2new-object*, by storing invisible pointers in 2old-object*.
It returns 2old-object*.
.end_defun

.defun forward-value-cell from-symbol to-symbol
This alters 2from-symbol* so that it always has the same value
as 2to-symbol*, by sharing its value cell.  A 2one-q-forward*
invisible pointer is stored into 2from-symbol*'s value cell.
Do not do this when 2from-symbol* is 3lambda*-bound, as
the microcode does not bother to check for that case (doing so would
make binding slower).
.end_defun

.section "Pointer Manipulation"

	It should again be emphasized that improper use of these functions
can destroy the Lisp environment, primarily because of interactions
between the garbage collector and  the illegal pointers that
can be created by these sub-primitives.

.c Narrative description of Q format, and data types, or pointer thereto.

.defun %data-type x
Returns the data-type field of 2x*, as a fixnum.
.end_defun

.defun %pointer x
Returns the pointer field of 2x*, as a fixnum.  For most
types, this is dangerous since the garbage collector can copy the object
and change its address.
.end_defun

.defun %make-pointer data-type pointer
This makes up a pointer, with 2data-type* in the data-type
field and 2pointer* in the pointer field, and returns it.  This is
most commonly used for changing the type of a pointer.  Do not use this
to make pointers which are not allowed to be in the machine, such as
3dtp-null*, invisible pointers, etc.
.end_defun

.defun %make-pointer-offset data-type pointer offset
This returns a pointer with 2data-type* in the data-type
field, and 2pointer* plus 2offset* in the pointer field.  The
types of the arguments are not checked, their pointer fields are simply
added together.  This is useful for constructing locative pointers
into the middle of an object.  However, note that it is illegal to
have a pointer to untyped data, such as the inside of a FEF or
a numeric array.
.end_defun

.defun %pointer-difference pointer-1 pointer-2
Returns a fixnum which is 2pointer-1* minus 2pointer-2*.
No type checks are made.  For the result to be meaningful, the two pointers
must point into the same object, so that their difference cannot change
as a result of garbage collection.
.end_defun

.defun %find-structure-header pointer
This subprimitive finds the structure into which 
2pointer* points, by searching backward for a header.
It is a basic low-level function used by such things as the
garbage collector.
2pointer* is normally a locative, but its data-type is ignored.
Note that it is illegal to point into an "unboxed" portion of
a structure, for instance the middle of a numeric array.

In structure space, the "containing structure" of a pointer
is well-defined by system storage conventions.  In list space,
it is considered to be the contiguous, cdr-coded segment of
list surrounding the location pointed to.  If a cons of the list
has been copied out by 3rplacd*, the contiguous list includes
that pair and ends at that point.
.end_defun

.defun %find-structure-leader pointer
This is identical to 3%find-structure-header*, except that if the
structure is an array with a leader, this returns a locative pointer
to the leader-header, rather than returning the array-pointer itself.
Thus the result of 3%find-structure-leader* is always the lowest
address in the structure.  This is the one used internally by the garbage collector.
.end_defun

.defun %structure-boxed-size object
Returns the number of "boxed Q's" in 2object*.  This is the number
of words at the front of the structure which contain normal Lisp objects.
Some structures, for example FEFs and numeric arrays, containing additional
"unboxed Q's" following their "boxed Q's".
Note that the boxed size of a PDL (either regular or special) does not
include Q's above the current top of the PDL.  These locations are boxed
but their contents is considered garbage, and is not protected by the
garbage collector.
.end_defun

.defun %structure-total-size object
Returns the total number of words occupied by the representation
of 2object*.
.end_defun

.section "Special Memory Referencing"

.defun %store-conditional pointer old new
This is the basic locking primitive.  2pointer* points to
a cell which is uninterruptibly read and written.  If the contents of
the cell is 3eq* to 2old*, then it is replaced by 2new* and
3t* is returned.  Otherwise, 3nil* is returned and the contents
of the cell is not changed.
.end_defun

The following four functions are for I/O programming.

.defun %unibus-read address
Returns the contents of the register at the specified Unibus
address, as a fixnum.  You must specify a full 18-bit address.  This
is guaranteed to read the location only once.  Since the Lisp
Machine Unibus does not support byte operations, this always references
a 16-bit word, and so 2address* will normally be an even number.
.end_defun

.defun %unibus-write address data
Writes the 16-bit number 2data* at the specified Unibus
address, exactly once.
.end_defun

.defun %xbus-read io-offset
Returns a fixnum which is the low 24 bits of the contents
of the register at the specified Xbus address.  2io-offset* is
an offset into the I/O portion of Xbus physical address space.
This is guaranteed to read the location exactly once.
.end_defun

.defun %xbus-write io-offset data
Writes the pointer field of 2data*, which should be a fixnum,
into the register at the specified Xbus address.
The high eight bits of the word written are always zero.
2io-offset* is
an offset into the I/O portion of Xbus physical address space.
This is guaranteed to write the location exactly once.
.end_defun

.defun %p-contents-offset base-pointer offset
This checks the cell pointed to by 2base-pointer* for
a forwarding pointer.  Having followed forwarding pointers to the
real structure pointed to, it adds 2offset* to the resulting
forwarded 2base-pointer* and returns the contents of that location.
.end_defun

.defun %p-contents-as-locative pointer
Given a pointer to a memory location containing a pointer which isn't
allowed to be "in the machine" (typically an invisible pointer)
this function returns the contents of the location as a 3dtp-locative*.  I.e.
it changes the disallowed data type to locative so that you can safely
look at it and see what it points to.
.end_defun

.defun %p-contents-as-locative-offset base-pointer offset
This checks the cell pointed to by 2base-pointer* for
a forwarding pointer.  Having followed forwarding pointers to the
real structure pointed to, it adds 2offset* to the resulting
forwarded 2base-pointer*, fetches the contents of that location,
and returns it with the data type changed to 3dtp-locative* in case
it was a type which isn't allowed to be "in the machine" (typically
an invisible pointer).  This is used, for example, to analyze the
3dtp-external-value-cell-pointer* pointers in a FEF, which are
used by the compiled code to reference value cells and function cells
of symbols.
.end_defun

.defun %p-store-contents pointer value
2value* is stored into the data-type and pointer
fields of the location addressed by 2pointer*.  The cdr-code
and flag-bit fields remain unchanged.  2value* is returned.
.end_defun

.defun %p-store-contents-offset value base-pointer offset
This checks the cell pointed to by 2base-pointer* for
a forwarding pointer.  Having followed forwarding pointers to the
real structure pointed to, it adds 2offset* to the resulting
forwarded 2base-pointer*, and stores 2value* into the data-type and pointer
fields of that location.  The cdr-code
and flag-bit fields remain unchanged.  2value* is returned.
.end_defun

.defun %p-store-tag-and-pointer pointer miscfields pntrfield
Creates a 2Q* by taking 8 bits from 2miscfields*
and 24 bits from 2pntrfield*, and stores that into the
location addressed by 2pointer*.  The low 5 bits of 2miscfields*
become the data-type, the next bit becomes the flag-bit, and the
top two bits become the cdr-code.  This is a good
way to store a forwarding pointer from one structure
to another (for example).
.end_defun

.defun %p-ldb ppss pointer
This is like 3ldb* but gets a byte from the location
addressed by 2pointer*.  Note that
you can load bytes out of the data type etc. bits, not just
the pointer field, and that the word loaded out of need not
be a fixnum.  The result returned is always a fixnum, unlike
3%p-contents* and friends.
.end_defun

.defun %p-ldb-offset ppss base-pointer offset
This checks the cell pointed to by 2base-pointer* for
a forwarding pointer.  Having followed forwarding pointers to the
real structure pointed to, the byte specified by 2ppss* is
loaded from the contents of the location addressed by the forwarded
2base-pointer* plus 2offset*, and returned as a fixnum.
This is the way to reference byte fields within a structure
without violating system storage conventions.
.end_defun

.defun %p-dpb value ppss pointer
The 2value*, a fixnum, is stored into the byte selected
by 2ppss* in the word addressed by 2pointer*.  3nil* is returned.
You can use this to alter data types, cdr codes, etc.
.end_defun

.defun %p-dpb-offset value ppss base-pointer offset
This checks the cell pointed to by 2base-pointer* for
a forwarding pointer.  Having followed forwarding pointers to the
real structure pointed to, the 2value* is stored into the byte specified by 2ppss* in
the location addressed by the forwarded
2base-pointer* plus 2offset*.  3nil* is returned.
This is the way to alter unboxed data within a structure
without violating system storage conventions.
.end_defun

.defun %p-mask-field ppss pointer
This is similar to 3%p-ldb*, except that the selected
byte is returned in its original position within the word instead
of right-aligned.
.end_defun

.defun %p-mask-field-offset ppss base-pointer offset
This is similar to 3%p-ldb-offset*, except that the selected
byte is returned in its original position within the word instead
of right-aligned.
.end_defun

.defun %p-deposit-field value ppss pointer
This is similar to 3%p-dpb*, except that the selected
byte is stored from the corresponding bits of 2value* rather than
the right-aligned bits.
.end_defun

.defun %p-deposit-field-offset value ppss base-pointer offset
This is similar to 3%p-dpb-offset*, except that the selected
byte is stored from the corresponding bits of 2value* rather than
the right-aligned bits.
.end_defun

.defun %p-pointer pointer
Extracts the pointer field of the contents of the
location addressed by 2pointer* and returns
it as a fixnum.
.end_defun

.defun %p-data-type pointer
Extracts the data-type field of the contents of the
location addressed by 2pointer* and returns
it as a fixnum.
.end_defun

.defun %p-cdr-code pointer
Extracts the cdr-code field of the contents of the
location addressed by 2pointer* and returns
it as a fixnum.
.end_defun

.defun %p-flag-bit pointer
Extracts the flag-bit field of the contents of the
location addressed by 2pointer* and returns
it as a fixnum.
.end_defun

.defun %p-store-pointer pointer value
Clobbers the pointer field of the location
addressed by 2pointer* to 2value*, and returns 2value*.
.end_defun

.defun %p-store-data-type pointer value
Clobbers the data-type field of the location
addressed by 2pointer* to 2value*, and returns 2value*.
.end_defun

.defun %p-store-cdr-code pointer value
Clobbers the cdr-code field of the location
addressed by 2pointer* to 2value*, and returns 2value*.
.end_defun

.defun %p-store-flag-bit pointer value
Clobbers the flag-bit field of the location
addressed by 2pointer* to 2value*, and returns 2value*.
.end_defun

.defun %stack-frame-pointer
Returns a locative pointer to its caller's stack frame.  This
function is not defined in the interpreted Lisp environment; it only works
from compiled code.  Since it turns into a "misc" instruction,
the "caller's stack frame" really means "the frame for the FEF
that executed the 3%stack-frame-pointer* instruction".
.end_defun

.defun bind locative value
[This will be renamed to 3%bind* in the future.]
Binds the cell pointed to by 2locative* to 2x*, in
the caller's environment. This
function is not defined in the interpreted Lisp environment; it only works
from compiled code.  Since it turns into an instruction,
the "caller's environment" really means "the binding block for the FEF
that executed the 3bind* instruction".
.end_defun

.defun %halt
Stops the machine.
.end_defun

.section "The Paging System"

.c Insert narrative description of the page hash table, etc.

[Someday this will discuss how it works.]

.defun si:%change-page-status virtual-address swap-status access-status-and-meta-bits
The page hash table entry for the page containing 2virtual-address*
is found and altered as specified.  3t* is returned if it was found,
3nil* if it was not (presumably the page is swapped out.)  2swap-status*
and 2access-status-and-meta-bits* can be 3nil* if those fields are not
to be changed.  This doesn't make any error checks; you can really
screw things up if you call it with the wrong arguments.
.end_defun

.defun si:%compute-page-hash virtual-address
This makes the hashing function for the page hash table
available to the user.
.end_defun

.defun si:%create-physical-page physical-address
This is used when adjusting the size of real memory available
to the machine.  It adds an entry for the page frame at 2physical-address*
to the page hash table, with virtual address -1, swap status flushable,
and map status 120 (read only).  This doesn't make error checks; you
can really screw things up if you call it with the wrong arguments.
.end_defun

.defun si:%delete-physical-page physical-address
If there is a page in the page frame at 2physical-address*,
it is swapped out and its entry is deleted from the page hash table,
making that page frame unavailable for swapping in of pages in the
future.  This doesn't make error checks; you
can really screw things up if you call it with the wrong arguments.
.end_defun

.defun si:%disk-restore high-16-bits low-16-bits
Loads virtual memory from the partition named by the catenation of
the two 16-bit arguments, and starts executing it.  The name 30*
refers to the default load (the one the machine loads when it is
started up).
.end_defun

.defun si:%disk-save physical-mem-size high-16-bits low-16-bits
Copies virtual memory into the partition named by the catenation
of the two 16-bit arguments (30* means the default), then restarts
the world, as if it had just been restored.  The 2physical-mem-size*
argument should come from 3%sys-com-memory-size* in 3system-communication-area*.
.end_defun

.section Microcode Variables

.end_defvar

.defvar si:%count-pdl-buffer-memory-faults
