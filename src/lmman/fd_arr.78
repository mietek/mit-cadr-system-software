.section "What Arrays Are"
	An 2array* is a Lisp object that consists of a group of cells,
each of which may contain a Lisp object.  The individual cells are
selected by numerical 2subscripts*.

.setq array-type page
.cindex types of arrays
	There are many types of arrays.  Some types of arrays can hold
Lisp objects of any type; the other types of arrays can only hold
fixnums.  The array types are known by a set of symbols symbols whose names
begin with "3art-*" (for ARray Type).

.defvar array-types
The value of 3array-types* is a list of all of the array type symbols
such as 3art-q*, 3art-4b*, 3art-string* and so on.
.end_defvar

.defun array-types array-type-code
An array of the array type symbols, indexed
by their internal numeric codes.
.end_defun

.defvar array-elements-per-q
3array-elements-per-q* is an association list (see (alist)) which
associates each array type symbol with the number of array elements
stored in one word, for an array of that type.
.end_defvar

.defun array-elements-per-q array-type-code
This is an array, indexed by the internal codes of the array types,
containing the number of array elements stored in one word, for an
array of that type.
.end_defun

.defvar array-bits-per-element
The value of 3array-bits-per-element* is an association list (see (alist))
which associates each array type symbol with the number of
bits of unsigned number it can hold, or 3nil* if it can
hold Lisp objects.  This can be used to tell whether an array
can hold Lisp objects or not.
.end_defvar

.defun array-bits-per-element array-type-code
This is an array, indexed by the internal codes of the array types, containing
the number of bits per cell for unsigned numeric arrays, and 3nil* for
full-Lisp-object-containing array.
.end_defun

.defun array-element-size array
Given an array, returns the number of bits that fit in an element of that
array.  For non-numeric arrays, the result is 24., assuming you will be
storing unsigned fixnums in the array.
.end_defun

	The most commonly used type is called 3art-q*.  An 3art-q* array simply
holds Lisp objects of any type.

	Similar to the 3art-q* type is the 3art-q-list*.  Like the 3art-q*,
its elements
may be any Lisp object.  The difference is that the 3art-q-list* array "doubles"
as a list; the function 3g-l-p* will take an 3art-q-list* array and return
a list object whose elements are those of the array, and whose actual substance
is that of the array.  If you 3rplaca* elements of the list, the corresponding
element of the array will change, and if you store into the array, the corresponding
element of the list will change the same way.

	There is a set of types called 3art-1b, art-2b, art-4b, art-8b* 
and 3art-16b*;
these names are short for "1 bit", "2 bits", and so on.  Each element
of an 3art-1b* array is a fixnum, and only one bit (the least significant)
is remembered in the array; all of the others are discarded.  Similarly,
in an 3art-2b* array, only the two least significant bits are remembered.
So if you store a 5 into an 3art-2b* array, for example, and look at it
later, you will find a 1 rather than a 5.
	These arrays are used when it is known beforehand that the
fixnums which will be stored are non-negative and limited in size to a
certain number of bits.  Their advantage over the 3art-q* array is
that they occupy less storage, because more than one element of the
array is kept in a single machine word.  (For example, 32 elements
(decimal) of an 3art-1b* array or 2 elements of an 3art-16b* array
will fit into one word).

	Character strings are implemented by the 3art-string* array
type.  This type acts similarly to the 3art-8b*; its elements must be
fixnums, of which only the least significant eight bits are stored. 
However, many important system functions, including 3read*,
3print*, and 3eval*, treat 3art-string* arrays very differently from
the other kinds of arrays.  These arrays are usually called 
2string*s, and an entire chapter of this manual deals with
functions which manipulate them. 

	There are three types of arrays which exist only for the
purposes of 2stack groups*; these types are called
3art-stack-group-head, art-special-pdl* and 3art-reg-pdl*.  Their elements
may be any Lisp object; their use is explained in the section on
stack groups (see (stack-group)).
'cindex "stack group"

	There are also two array types which exist only for the TV
output device; these are called 3art-tvb* and 3art-tvb-pixel*.  The former
holds one bit of a fixnum (like an 3art-1b* array), and the latter is
more complicated.  Their use is described in the section on the TV (see (tv)).
'cindex "tv"

.section "How Arrays Work"

	The 2dimensionality* of an array (or, the number of dimensions
which the array has) is the number of subscripts used to
refer to one of the elements of the array.  The dimensionality
may be any integer from one to seven, inclusively.
.c How about zero?

	The lowest value for any subscript is zero; the highest value
is a property of the array.  Each dimension has a size, which is
the lowest number which is too great to be used as a subscript.
For example, in a one dimensional array of five elements, the size
of the one and only dimension is five, and the acceptable
values of the subscript are zero, one, two, three, and four.

	The most basic primitive subrs for handling arrays are:
3make-array*, which is used for the creation of arrays, 3aref*,
which is used for examining the
contents of arrays, and 3aset*, which
is used for storing into arrays.

	An array is a regular Lisp object, and it is common for an
array to be the binding of a symbol, or the car or cdr of a cons,
or, in fact, an element of an array.  Another way of handling
arrays, inherited from Maclisp, is to treat them as functions.
In this case each array has a name, which is a symbol whose function
definition is the array.  The Lisp machine supports this style by
allowing an array to be 2applied* to arguments, as if it were a function.  The
arguments are treated as subscripts and the array is referenced
appropriately.  The 3store* special form (see (store-fun)) is also
supported.  This form of array referencing is considered to be obsolete,
and should not be used in new programs.

	Here are some issues of Maclisp compatibility:

	Fixnum arrays do not exist (however, see the Lisp machine's small-positive-number
arrays).  Flonum arrays do not (currently) exist.
"Un-garbage-collected" arrays do not exist.
'c yet??? --weak links
Readtables and obarrays are represented as arrays, but unlike Maclisp special
array types are not used.  See the descriptions
of 3read* ((read-fun)) and 3intern* ((intern-fun)) for
information about readtables and obarrays (packages).
There are no "dead" arrays, nor are Multics "external" arrays provided.

Subscripts are always checked for validity, regardless of the value
of 3*rset* and whether the code is compiled or not. 
However, in a multi-dimensional array, an error is only caused
if the subscripts would have resulted in a reference to storage
outside of the array; so if you have a 2 by 7 array and refer
to an element with subscripts 3 and 1, no error will
be caused despite the fact that the reference is invalid;
but if you refer to element 1 by 100, an error will be caused.
In other words, any subscript error which is not detected
will only refer to somewhere else in your array, and not
to any other part of storage.

3loadarrays* and 3dumparrays* are not provided.  However,
arrays can be put into "QFASL" files; see the section on fasloading
((fasload-fun)).

.section "Extra Features of Arrays"
'cindex "array leader"
	Any array may have an 2array leader*.  An array leader is
like a one-dimensional 3art-q* array which is attached to the main array.  So
an array which has a leader acts like two arrays joined together.  It
can be stored in and examined by a special set of functions which are
analogous to those used for the main array: 3array-leader* and
3store-array-leader*.  The leader is always one-dimensional, and
always can hold any kind of Lisp object, regardless of the type or
dimensionality of the array.

	By convention, the zeroth element of the array leader of
an array is used to hold the number of elements in the array
that are "active" in some sense.  When the zeroth element is used
this way, it is called a 2fill pointer*.
'cindex "fill pointer"
Specifically, if a string (an array of type 3art-string*) has
seven elements, but it has a fill pointer of five, then only elements
zero through four of the string are considered to be "active";  the string's
printed representation will be five characters long, string-searching
functions will stop after the fifth element, etc.

	The second element is also used in conjunction with the "named
structure" feature; see (named-structure).

'cindex "displaced array"
	The following explanation of 2displaced arrays*
is probably not of interest to a beginner; the section may
be passed over without losing the continuity of the manual.

	Normally, an array consists of a small amount of header information,
followed by the contents of the array.  However, sometimes it is desirable
to have the header information removed from the actual contents.  One
such occasion is when the contents of the array must be located in a
special part of the Lisp Machine's address space, such as the area used
for the control of input/output devices.  Displaced arrays are also
used to reference certain special system tables, which are at fixed
addresses so the microcode can access them easily.

	If you give 3make-array* a fixnum as its fourth argument,
it will create a displaced array refering to that location of virtual memory.
References to elements of the displaced array will access that part
of storage, and return the contents; the regular 3aref* and
3aset* functions are used.  If the array is one whose elements
are Lisp objects, caution should be used: if the region of address
space does not contain typed Lisp objects, the integrity of the storage
system could be damaged by the garbage collector.  If the array is one
whose elements are bytes (such as an 3art-4b* type), then there
is no problem.  It is important to know, in this case, that the elements
of such arrays are allocated from the right to the left within the 32-bit
words.  See the description of internal array formats on (array-format).

'cindex "indirect array"
.setq indirect-array page
.cindex indirect arrays
	It is also possible to have an array whose contents, instead
of being located at a fixed place in virtual memory, are defined
to be those of another array.  Such an array is called an 2indirect array*,
and is created by giving 3make-array* an array as its fourth argument.
The effects of this are simple if both arrays have the same type; the two
arrays share all elements.  An object stored in a certain element
of one can be retrieved from the corresponding element of the other.
This, by itself, is not very useful.  However, if the arrays have
different dimensionality, the manner of accessing the elements differs.
Thus, by creating a one-dimensional array of nine elements which was
indirected to a second, two-dimensional array of three elements by three,
then the elements could be accessed in either a one-dimensional or
a two-dimensional manner.  Even more complex effects can be produced if
the new array is of a different type than the old array; see the description
of internal array formats on (array-format).

'cindex "index offset"
.setq index-offset page
	It is also possible to create a one-dimensional indirect array
in such a way that when an attempt is made to reference it or store
into it, a constant number is added to the subscript given.  This
number is called the 2index-offset*, and is specified at the time
the indirect array is created, by giving a fixnum to 3make-array* as
its sixth argument.  The 3nsubstring* function (see (nsubstring-fun)) creates such
arrays. 
'findex "nsubstring"

.section "Basic Array Functions"

.defun make-array area type dims &optional displaced-p leader index-offset named-structure
	This creates and returns an array, according to various specifications.   

	The 2area* parameter specifies the area in which to allocate
the array's storage; if you are not concerned with areas, simply use the value of
3default-array-area*.  For convenience, if 2area* is 3nil*,
3default-array-area* is used instead. 

	2type* should be a symbolic name of an array type; the most
common of these is 3art-q*.  The elements of the array are
initialized according to the type:  if the array is of a type whose
elements may only be fixnums, then every element of the array will
initially be 30*; otherwise, every element will initially be
3nil*.  See the description of array types on (array-type).
'cindex "array initialization"

	2dims* should be a list of fixnums which are the dimensions of the array;
the length of the list will be the dimensionality of the array.  For convenience,
if the dimensionality should be one, the single dimension may be provided as
a fixnum in place of the list.

.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(setq a (make-array nil 'art-q 5))       1; Create a one-d array*
					 1;of 5 elements.*

(setq b (make-array nil 'art-4b '(3 4))) 1; Create a four-bit two-d*
					 1;array, 3 by 4.*
.end_lisp

	If 2displaced-p* is not 3nil*, then the array will be a 2displaced*
array.  2displaced-p* may either be a fixnum, to create a regular displaced array
which refers to a certain section of virtual address space, or an array, to create
an indirect array (see (indirect-array)).
'cindex "displaced array"
'cindex "indirect array"

	If 2leader* is not 3nil*, then the array will be given a
leader.  If 2leader* is a fixnum, the array's leader will be
2leader* elements long, and its elements will be initialized to
3nil*.  2Leader* may also be a list, in which case the length of
the leader is equal to that of the list, and the elements are
initialized to the elements of the list, in reverse order (i.e., the
car of the list is stored in the highest-subscripted location in the
leader).

	If 2index-offset* is present, 2displaced-p* should be an
array, and 2index-offset* should be a fixnum; it is made to be the
index-offset of the created indirect array. (See (index-offset).)
'cindex "index offset"

	If 2named-structure* is not 3nil*, it is a symbol to
be stored in the named-structure cell element of the array.  The array
created will be a named structure (see (named-structure).)
.lisp
.exdent 96 Examples:
(make-array nil 'art-q 5 nil 3)   1;;leader 3 elements long.*
(setq a (make-array nil 'art-1b 100 nil '(t nil)))
(array-leader a 0) => nil
(array-leader a 1) => t
.end_lisp
'cindex "array leader"

	3make-array* returns the newly-created array, and also returns, as
a second value, the number of words allocated from 2area* in the process
of creating the array.
.end_defun

.defun array-displaced-p array
2array* may be any kind of array.
This predicate returns 3t* if 2array* is any kind of displaced array
(including indirect arrays).  Otherwise it returns 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun array-indirect-p array
2array* may be any kind of array.
This predicate returns 3t* if 2array* is an indirect array.
Otherwise it returns 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun array-indexed-p array
2array* may be any kind of array.
This predicate returns 3t* if 2array* is an indirect array with an index-offset.
Otherwise it returns 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun adjust-array-size array new-size
	2array* should be a one-dimensional array.  Its size is
changed to be 2new-size*.  If this results in making 2array*
smaller, then the extra elements are lost; if 2array* is made
bigger, the new elements are initialized in the same fashion as
3make-array* (see (make-array-fun)): either to 3nil* or 30*. 
[Currently there is a bug which causes initialization to zero not to work.]
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(setq a (make-array nil 'art-q 5))
(aset 'foo a 4)
(aref a 4) => foo
(adjust-array-size a 2)
(aref a 4) => ERROR
.end_lisp
	If the size of the array is being increased, 3adjust-array-size*
must allocate a new array somewhere; it then alters 2array* so that
references to it will be made to the new array instead, by means of
an "invisible pointer".  3adjust-array-size* will return this
new array if it creates one, and otherwise it will return 2array*.
Be careful about using the returned result of 3adjust-array-size*,
because you may end up holding two arrays which are not the same
(i.e., not 3eq*) which share the same contents.
.end_defun

.defun return-array array
Return 2array* to free storage.  If it is displaced,
this returns the pointer, not the data pointed to.  Currently
does nothing if the array is not at the end of its area.
This will eventually be renamed to 3reclaim*, when
it works for other objects than arrays.
.end_defun

.defun aref array &rest subscripts
Returns the element of 2array* selected by the 2subscripts*.
The 2subscripts* must be fixnums and their number must match the
dimensionality of 2array*.
.end_defun

.defun ar-1 array i
2array* should be a one-dimensional array, and 2i* should be a
fixnum.  This returns the 2i*'th element of 2array*. 
.end_defun

.defun ar-2 array i j
2array* should be a two-dimensional array, and 2i* and 2j* should be 
fixnums.  This returns the 2i* by 2j*'th element of 2array*.
.end_defun

.defun ar-3 array i j k
2array* should be a three-dimensional array, and 2i*, 2j*, and
2k* should be  fixnums.  This returns the 2i* by 2j* by 2k*'th
element of 2array*. 
.end_defun

.defun aset x array &rest subscripts
Stores 2x* into the element of 2array* selected by the 2subscripts*.
The 2subscripts* must be fixnums and their number must match the
dimensionality of 2array*.  The returned value is 2x*.
.end_defun

.defun as-1 x array i
2array* should be a one-dimensional array, and 2i* should be a
fixnum.  2x* may be any object.  2x* is stored in the 2i*'th element
of 2array*.  3as-1* returns 2x*.
.end_defun

.defun as-2 x array i j
2array* should be a two-dimensional array, and 2i* and 2j* should be 
fixnums.  2x* may be any object.  2x* is stored in the 2i* by 2j*'th
element of 2array*.  3as-2* returns 2x*.
.end_defun

.defun as-3 x array i j k
2array* should be a three-dimensional array, and 2i*, 2j*, and
2k* should be fixnums.  2x* may be any object.  2x* is stored in
the 2i* by 2j* by 2k*'th element of 2array*.  3as-3* returns
2x*. 
.end_defun

.defun aloc array &rest subscripts
Returns a locative pointer to the element-cell of 2array* selected by
the 2subscripts*.  The 2subscripts* must be fixnums and their
number must match the dimensionality of 2array*.
.end_defun

.defun ap-1 array i
2array* should be a one-dimensional array whose elements contain Lisp
objects, and 2i* should be a
fixnum.  This returns a locative pointer to the 2i*'th element of
2array*.  See the explanation of locatives, (locative).
.end_defun

.defun ap-2 array i j
2array* should be a two-dimensional array whose elements contain Lisp
objects, and 2i* and 2j*
should be  fixnums.  This returns a locative pointer to the 2i* by
2j*'th element of 2array*.  See the explanation of locatives, (locative).
.end_defun

.defun ap-3 array i j k
2array* should be a three-dimensional array whose elements contain Lisp
objects, and 2i*, 2j*, and
2k* should be  fixnums.  This returns a locative pointer to the
2i* by 2j* by 2k*'th element of 2array*.
See the explanation of locatives, (locative).
.end_defun

The compiler turns 3aref* into 3ar-1*, 3ar-2*, etc. according
to the number of subscripts specified, turns 3aset* into 3as-1*,
3as-2*, etc., and turns 3aloc* into 3ap-1*, 3ap-2*, etc.
For arrays with more than 3 dimensions the compiler uses the slightly less
efficient form since the special routines only exist for 1, 2, and 3 dimensions.
There is no reason for any program to call 3ar-1*, 3as-1*, 3ar-2*, etc.
explicitly; they are documented because there used to be such a reason, and
many existing programs use these functions.  New programs should use 3aref*,
3aset*, and 3aloc*.

.defun arraycall ignored array &rest subscripts
3(arraycall nil 2array* 2sub1* 2sub2*...)* is the same
as 3(aref 2array* 2sub1* 2sub2*...)*.  It exists for
Maclisp compatibility.
.end_defun

.defun get-list-pointer-into-array array-ref
.c This will probably be renamed, if anyone can think of a better name
The argument 2array-ref* is ignored, but should be a reference
to an 3art-q-list* array by applying the array to subscripts (rather
than by 3aref*).  This returns a list object which
is a portion of the "list" of the array, beginning with the last
element of the array which has been referenced.
.end_defun

.defun g-l-p array
.c This will probably be renamed, if anyone can think of a better name
2array* should be an 3art-q-list* array.  This returns
a list which shares the storage of 2array*.  The 3art-q-list*
type exists so that 3g-l-p* can be used.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(setq a (make-array nil 'art-q-list 4))
(aref a 0) => nil
(setq b (g-l-p a)) => (nil nil nil nil)
(rplaca b t)
b => (t nil nil nil)
(aref a 0) => t
(aset 30 a 2)
b => (t nil 30 nil)
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun get-locative-pointer-into-array array-ref
.c This will probably be flushed?
3get-locative-pointer-into-array* is
similar to 3get-list-pointer-into-array*, except that it returns a
locative, and doesn't require the array to be 3art-q-list*.
.end_defun

.defun arraydims array
2array* may be any array; it also may be a symbol whose
function cell contains an array, for Maclisp compatibility
(see (maclisp-array)).
It returns a list whose first element is the symbolic name of
the type of 2array*, and whose remaining elements are its dimensions.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(setq a (make-array nil 'art-q '(3 5)))
(arraydims a) => (art-q 3 5)
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun array-dimensions array
3array-dimensions* returns a list whose elements are the dimensions
of 2array*.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(setq a (make-array nil 'art-q '(3 5)))
(array-dimensions a) => (3 5)
.end_lisp
Note: the list returned by 3(array-dimensions 2x*)* is
equal to the cdr of the list returned by 3(arraydims 2x*)*.
.end_defun

.defun array-in-bounds-p array &rest subscripts
This function checks whether the 2subscripts* are all
legal subscripts for 2array*, and returns 3t* if they
are; otherwise it returns 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun array-length array
2array* may be any array.  This returns the total number
of elements in 2array*.  For a one-dimensional array,
this is one greater than the maximum allowable subscript.
(But if fill pointers are being used, you may want to use
3array-active-length* (see (array-active-length-fun))).
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(array-length (make-array nil 'art-q 3)) => 3
(array-length (make-array nil 'art-q '(3 5)))
		=> 17  1;octal, which is 15. decimal*
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun array-/#-dims array
Returns the dimensionality of 2array*.  Note that the name of the
function includes a "#", which must be slashified if you want to be
able to compile your program with the compiler running in Maclisp.
.lisp
.exdent 96 Example:
(array-/#-dims (make-array nil 'art-q '(3 5))) => 2
.end_lisp
.end_defun

.defun array-dimension-n n array
2array* may be any kind of array, and 2n* should be a fixnum.
If 2n* is between 1 and the dimensionality of 2array*,
this returns the 2n*'th dimension of 2array*.  If 2n* is 30*,
it returns the length of the leader of 2array*; if 2array* has no
leader it returns 3nil*.  If 2n* is any other value, it
returns 3nil*.

.defun fillarray array x
Note: for the present, all arrays concerned must be one-dimensional.
	2array* may be any type of array, or, for Maclisp
compatibility, a symbol whose function cell contains an array.  There
are two forms of this function, depending on the type of 2x*. 
	If 2x* is a list, then 3fillarray* fills up 2array* with
the elements of 2list*.  If 2x* is too short to fill up all of
2array*, then the last element of 2x* is used to fill the
remaining elements of 2array*.  If 2x* is too long, the extra
elements are ignored. 
	If 2x* is an array (or, for Maclisp compatibility, a symbol
whose function cell contains an array), then the elements of 2array* are
filled up from the elements of 2x*.  If 2x* is too small, then
the extra elements of 2array* are not affected.
	3fillarray* returns 2array*.
.end_defun

.defun listarray array &optional limit
Note: for the present, all arrays concerned must be one-dimensional.
	2array* may be any type of array, or, for Maclisp
compatibility, a symbol whose function cell contains an array.  
3listarray* creates and returns a list whose elements are those of
2array*.  If 2limit* is present, it should be a fixnum, and only
the first 2limit* (if there are more than that many) elements of
2array* are used, and so the maximum length of the returned list is
2limit*. 
.end_defun

.defun copy-array-contents from to
2from* and 2to* must be arrays.  The contents of 2from*
is copied into the contents of 2to*, element by element.
2Presently the first subscript varies fastest
in multi-dimensional arrays (opposite from Maclisp).*
If 2to* is shorter than 2from*,
the excess is ignored.  If 2from* is shorter than
2to*, the rest of 2to* is filled with 3nil* if it
is a q-type array or 0 if it is a numeric array or 200 if it is a string.
3t* is always returned.
.end_defun

.defun copy-array-portion from-array from-start from-end to-array to-start to-end
The portion of the array 2from-array* with indices greater than or
equal to 2from-start* and less than 2from-end* is copied into
the portion of the array 2to-array* with indices greater than or
equal to 2to-start* and less than 2to-end*, element by element.
If there are more elements in 2to-array*, the extra elements are filled as
in 3copy-array-contents*.
3t* is always returned.

.section "Array Leaders"
'cindex "array leader"
	Array leaders were introduced at the beginning of the chapter.
This section presents various functions which operate on array leaders.

.defun array-has-leader-p array
2array* may be any array.  This predicate returns 3t* if 2array*
has a leader; otherwise it returns 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun array-leader-length array
2array* may be any array.  This returns the length of 2array*'s leader
if it has one, or 3nil* if it does not.
.end_defun

.defun array-leader array i
2array* should be an array with a leader, and 2i* should be a
fixnum.  This returns the 2i*'th element of 2array*'s leader.
This is analogous to 3aref*.
.end_defun

.defun store-array-leader x array i
2array* should be an array with a leader, and 2i* should be a
fixnum.  2x* may be any object.  2x* is stored in the 2i*'th element
of 2array*'s leader.  3store-array-leader* returns 2x*.
This is analogous to 3aset*.
.end_defun

.defun ap-leader array i
2array* should be an array with a leader, and 2i* should be a
fixnum.  This returns a locative pointer to the 2i*'th element of
2array*'s leader.  See the explanation of locatives, (locative).
This is analogous to 3aloc*.
.end_defun

.defun array-active-length array
If 2array* does not have a fill pointer, then this returns whatever
3(array-length 2array*)* would have.  If 2array* does have a
fill pointer, 3array-active-length* returns it.  See the general
explanation of the use of fill pointers, which is at the beginning of
this section.
.end_defun

.defun array-push array x
2array* must be a one-dimensional array which has a fill pointer, and 2x* may
be any object.  3array-push* attempts to store 2x* in the element
of the array designated by the fill pointer, and increase the fill pointer
by one.  If the fill pointer does not designate an element of the array (specifically,
when it gets too big), it is unaffected and 3array-push* returns 3nil*;
otherwise, the two actions (storing and incrementing) happen uninterruptibly,
and 3array-push* returns the 2former* value of the fill pointer
(one less than the one it leaves in the array).  If the array is of type
3art-q-list*, an operation similar to 3nconc* has taken place,
in that the element has been added to the list by changing the cdr of
the formerly last element.
.end_defun

.defun array-push-extend array x
3array-push-extend* is just like 3array-push* except
that if the fill pointer gets too large, the array is grown
to fit the new element; i.e. it never "fails" the way 3array-push* does,
and so never returns 3nil*.
.end_defun

.defun array-pop array
2array* must be a one-dimensional array which has a fill pointer.
The fill pointer is decreased by one, and the array element
designated by the new value of the fill pointer is returned.
If the new value does not designate any element of the array
(specifically, if it has reached zero), an error is caused.
The two operations (decrementing and array referencing) happen
uninterruptibly.  If the array is of type 3art-q-list*, an operation
similar to 3nbutlast* has taken place.
.c ??? or will, anyway.
.end_defun

.defun list-array-leader array &optional limit
2array* may be any type of array, or, for Maclisp
compatibility, a symbol whose function cell contains an array.  
3list-array-leader* creates and returns a list whose elements are those of
2array*'s leader.  If 2limit* is present, it should be a fixnum, and only
the first 2limit* (if there are more than that many) elements of
2array*'s leader are used, and so the maximum length of the returned list is
2limit*. If 2array* has no leader, 3nil* is returned.
.end_defun

.defun copy-array-contents-and-leader from to
This is just like 3copy-array-contents* (see (copy-array-contents-fun)), but the leaders
of 2from* and 2to* are also copied.
.end_defun

.section "Maclisp Array Compatibility"
.setq maclisp-array page
	Note: the functions in this section should not be used in new
programs.
	In Maclisp, arrays are usually kept on the 3array* property
of symbols, and the symbols are used instead of the arrays.  In order
to provide some degree of compatibility for this manner of using
arrays, the 3array*, 3*array*, and 3store* functions are
provided, and when arrays are applied to arguments, the arguments are
treated as subscripts and 3apply* returns the corresponding element
of the array.  However, the 3*rearray*, 3loadarrays*, and
3dumparrays* functions are not provided.  Also, 3flonum*,
3readtable*, and 3obarray* type arrays are not supported.  

.defun array &quote symbol type &eval &rest dims
	This creates an 3art-q* type array in 3default-array-area*
with the given dimensions.  (That is, 2dims* is given
to 3make-array* as its third argument.)  2type* is ignored.
If 2symbol* is 3nil*, the array is returned; otherwise,
the array is put in the function cell of 2symbol*, and 2symbol*
is returned.
.end_defun


.defun *array symbol type &rest dims
	This is just like 3array*, except that all of the arguments
are evaluated.
.end_defun

.defun store &quote array-ref x
2x* may be any object; 2array-ref* should be a form which
references an array by calling it as a function (3aref* forms are not
acceptable).  First 2x* is evaluated, then 2array-ref* is
evaluated, and then the value of 2x* is stored into the array cell
which was referenced by the evaluation of 2array-ref*.
.end_defun

.defun xstore x array-ref
	This is just like 3store*, but it is not
a special form; this is because the arguments are in the other
order.  This function only exists for the compiler to compile the
3store* special form, and should never be used by programs.
.end_defun
