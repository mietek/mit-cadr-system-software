.section "The Lisp Top Level"

	These functions constitute the Lisp top level,
and its associated functions.

.defun si:lisp-top-level
This is the first function called in the initial Lisp environment.
It calls 3lisp-reinitialize*, clears the screen, and calls 3si:lisp-top-level1*.
.end_defun

.defun lisp-reinitialize
This function does a wide variety of things, such as resetting the values
of various global constants and initializing the error system.
.end_defun

.defun si:lisp-top-level1
This is the actual top level loop.  It prints out "3105 FOOBAR*" and
then goes into a loop reading a form from 3standard-input*,
evaluating it, and printing the result (with slashification) to
3standard-output*.  If several values are returned by the form
all of them will be printed.  Also the values of 3**, 3+*, and 3-*
are maintained (see below).
.end_defun

.defspec break
3break* is used to enter a breakpoint loop, which is similar
to a Lisp top level loop.  3(break 2tag*)* will always
enter the loop; 3(break 2tag* 2conditional-form*)*
will evaluate 2conditional-form* and only enter the break loop
if it returns non-3nil*.  If the break loop is entered, 3break*
prints out
.lisp
;bkpt 2tag*
.end_lisp
and then enters a loop reading, evaluating, and printing forms.
A difference between a break loop and the top level loop
is that after reading a form, 3break* checks for the
following special cases: if the symbol 3g* is typed,
3break* throws back to the Lisp top level.  If 3p*
is typed, 3break* returns 3nil*.  If 3(return 2form*)*
is typed, 3break* evaluates 2form* and returns the result.
.end_defun

.defvar -
While a form is being evaluated by a read-eval-print loop,
3-* is bound to the form itself.
.end_defvar

.defvar +
While a form is being evaluated by a read-eval-print loop,
3+* is bound to the previous form that was read by the loop.
.end_defvar

.defvar *
While a form is being evaluated by a read-eval-print loop,
3** is bound to the result printed the last time through
the loop.  If there were several values printed (because
of a multiple-value return), 3** is bound to the first
value.
.end_defvar

.defvar lisp-initialization-list
The value of 3lisp-initialization-list* is a list of forms, which
are sequentially evaluated by 3lisp-reinitialize*.
.end_defvar

.defvar lisp-crash-list
The value of 3lisp-crash-list* is a list of forms.
3lisp-reinitialize* sequentially evaluates these
forms, and then sets 3lisp-crash-list* to 3nil*.
.end_defvar

.section "Logging In"

	Logging in tells the Lisp Machine who you are, so that
other users can see who is logged in, you can receive messages,
and your INIT file can be run.  An INIT file is a Lisp program
which gets loaded when you log in; it can be used to set up
a personalized environment.  The init file is named 2user*; .LISPM (INIT)
if you have a directory.

	When you log out, it should be possible to undo any
personalizations you have made so that they do not affect the next user
of the machine.  Therefore, anything done by an INIT file should be
undoable.  In order to do this, for every form in the INIT file, a Lisp
form to undo its effects should be added to the list which is the value
of 3logout-list*.  The functions 3login-setq* and 3login-eval*
help make this easy; see below.

.defvar user-id
The value of 3user-id* is either the name of the logged in user, as a string,
or else an empty string if there is no user logged in.
It appears in the who-line.
.end_defvar

.defvar logout-list
The value of 3logout-list* is a list of forms which are evaluated
when a user logs out.
.end_defvar

.defun login name
If anyone is logged into the machine, 3login* logs him out.
(See 3logout*.)
Then 3user-id* is set from 2name*.
Finally 3login* attempts to find your INIT file.
It first looks in "2user-id*; .LISPM (INIT)",
then in "(INIT); 2user-id* .LISPM",
and finally in the default init file "(INIT); * .LISPM".
When it finds one of these that exists, it loads it in.
3login* returns 3t*.
.end_defun

.defun logout
First, 3logout* evaluates the forms on 3logout-list*.
Then it tries to find a file to run, looking
first in "2user-id*; .LSPM_ (INIT)",
then in "(INIT); 2user-id* .LSPM_",
and finally in the default file "(INIT); * .LSPM_".
If and when it finds one it these that exists, it loads it in.
Then it sets 3user-id* to an empty string and 3logout-list*
to 3nil*, and returns 3t*.
.end_defun

.defspec login-setq
3login-setq* is like 3setq* except that it puts
a 3setq* form on 3logout-list* to set the variables
to their previous values.
.end_defun

.defun login-eval x
3login-eval* is used for functions which are "meant to be called"
from INIT files, such as 3eine:ed-redefine-keys*, which conveniently
return a form to undo what they did.  3login-eval* adds
the result of the form 2x* to the 3logout-list*.
.end_defun
.eof
